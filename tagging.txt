Tips regarding DocBook XML tagging
==================================

To get entries in the Index at the back, add entries like this in the
docbook source:

  <indexterm><primary>ABC</primary></indexterm>

This will result in the entry ABC showing up in the Index, with a
reference to the page where it is mentioned.

To get two levels in the index at the back, add entries like this to
the docbook source:

  <indexterm>
  <primary>artists</primary>
  <secondary>publicity rights on images of</secondary>
  </indexterm>

To index a range of paragrams/pages:

  <indexterm id="idxexchap" class='startofrange'>
    <primary>Example Chapter</primary></indexterm>
  ...
  <indexterm startref="idxexchap" class="endofrange"/>

Docbook processing
------------------

xmlto with fop backend

 - Overlap footnote and text body in some cases (BTS #683197)

 - incorrect index (missing page numbers for some, create wrong page
   number for some).

 - missing images (possibly BTS #567122)

xmlto with default backend

 - fail to process the docbook source (possibly BTW #683163)

dblatex

 - do not end a <part> when it should, gluing following chapters as if
   they belonged to the last <part> (BTS #683166).

 - Incorrect hyphens for multipage index references (BTS #682901)
