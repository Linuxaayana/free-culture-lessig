David Pogue, en glimrende skribent og forfatter av utallige tekniske
datarelaterte tekster, skrev dette på slutten av hans gjennomgang av min
første bok, <em class="citetitle">Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace</em>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I motsetning til faktiske lover, så har ikke internett-programvare
kapasiteten til å straffe.  Den påvirker ikke folk som ikke er online (og
kun en veldig liten minoritet av verdens befolkning er online).  Og hvis du
ikke liker systemet på internett, så kan du alltid slå av
modemet.<sup>[<a name="preface01" href="#ftn.preface01" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Pogue var skeptisk til argumentet som er kjernen av boken &#8212; at
programvaren, eller "koden", fungerte som en slags lov &#8212; og foreslo i
sin anmeldelse den lykkelig tanken at hvis livet i cyberspace gikk dårlig,
så kan vi alltid som med en trylleformel slå over en bryter og komme hjem
igjen. Slå av modemet, koble fra datamaskinen, og eventuelle problemer som
finnes <span class="emphasis"><em>den</em></span> virkeligheten ville ikke "påvirke" oss mer.
</p><p>

Pogue kan ha hatt rett i 1999 &#8212; jeg er skeptisk, men det kan
hende. Men selv om han hadde rett da, så er ikke argumentet gyldig
nå. <em class="citetitle">Fri Kultur</em> er om problemene internett forårsaker
selv etter at modemet er slått av.  Den er et argument om hvordan slagene
som nå brer om seg i livet on-line har fundamentalt påvirket "folk som er
ikke pålogget."  Det finnes ingen bryter som kan isolere oss fra
internettets effekt.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2629553"></a><p>
Men i motsetning til i boken <em class="citetitle">Code</em>, er argumentet her
ikke så mye om internett i seg selv. Istedet er det om konsekvensen av
internett for en del av vår tradisjon som er mye mer grunnleggende, og
uansett hvor hardt dette er for en geek-wanna-be å innrømme, mye viktigere.
</p><p>
Den tradisjonen er måten vår kultur blir laget på.  Som jeg vil forklare i
sidene som følger, kommer vi fra en tradisjon av "fri kultur"&#8212;ikke
"fri" som i "fri bar" (for å låne et uttrykk fra stifteren av fri
programvarebevegelsen<sup>[<a name="id2629535" href="#ftn.id2629535" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>), men "fri" som i
"talefrihet", "fritt marked", "frihandel", "fri konkurranse", "fri vilje" og
"frie valg".  En fri kultur støtter og beskytter skapere og oppfinnere.
Dette gjør den direkte ved å tildele immaterielle rettigheter.  Men det gjør
den indirekte ved å begrense rekkevidden for disse rettighetene, for å
garantere at neste generasjon skapere og oppfinnere forblir <span class="emphasis"><em>så fri
som mulig</em></span> fra kontroll fra fortiden.  En fri kultur er ikke en
kultur uten eierskap, like lite som et fritt marked er et marked der alt er
gratis.  Det motsatte av fri kultur er "tillatelseskultur"&#8212;en kultur
der skapere kun kan skape med tillatelse fra de mektige, eller fra skaperne
fra fortiden.
</p><p>
Hvis vi forsto denne endringen, så tror jeg vi ville stå imot den.  Ikke
"vi" på venstresiden eller "dere" på høyresiden, men vi som ikke har
investert i den bestemt kulturindustrien som har definert det tjuende
århundre. Enten du er på venstre eller høyresiden, hvis du i denne forstand
ikke har interesser, vil historien jeg forteller her gi deg problemer. For
endringene jeg beskriver påvirker verdier som begge sider av vår politiske
kultur anser som grunnleggende.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2630534"></a><p>
Vi så et glimt av dette tverrpolitiske raseri på forsommeren i 2003. Da FCC
vurderte endringer i reglene for medieeierskap som ville slakke på
begrensningene rundt mediekonsentrasjon, sendte en ekstraordinær koalisjon
mer enn 700 000 brev til FCC for å motsette seg endringen.  Mens William
Safire beskrev å marsjere "ubehagelig sammen med CodePink Women for Peace
and the National Rifle Association, mellom liberale Olympia Snowe og
konservative Ted Stevens", formulerte han  kanskje det enkleste uttrykket
for hva som var på spill: konsentrasjonen av makt.  Så spurte han:
<a class="indexterm" name="id2630553"></a>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Høres dette ikke-konservativt ut?  Ikke for meg.  Denne konsentrasjonen av
makt&#8212;politisk, selskapsmessig, pressemessig, kulturelt&#8212;bør være
bannlyst av konservative.  Spredningen av makt gjennom lokal kontroll, og
derigjennom oppmuntre til individuell deltagelse, er essensen i føderalismen
og det største uttrykk for demokrati.<sup>[<a name="id2630576" href="#ftn.id2630576" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Denne idéen er et element i argumentet til <em class="citetitle">Fri
Kultur</em>, selv om min fokus ikke bare er på konsentrasjonen av
makt som følger av konsentrasjonen i eierskap, men mer viktig, og fordi det
er mindre synlig, på konsentrasjonen av makt som er resultat av en radikal
endring i det effektive virkeområdet til loven.  Loven er i endring, og
endringen forandrer på hvordan vår kultur blir skapt. Den endringen bør
bekymre deg&#8212;Uansett om du bryr deg om internett eller ikke, og uansett
om du er til venstre for Safires eller til høyre. Inspirasjonen til tittelen
og mye av argumentet i denne boken kommer fra arbeidet til Richard Stallman
og Free Software Foundation. Faktisk, da jeg leste Stallmans egne tekster på
nytt, spesielt essyene i <em class="citetitle">Free Software, Free Society</em>,
innser jeg at alle de teoretiske innsiktene jeg utvikler her er innsikter
som Stallman beskrev for tiår siden.  Man kan dermed godt argumentere for at
dette verket kun er et avledet verk.
</p><p>

Jeg godtar kritikken, hvis det faktisk er kritikk.  Arbeidet til en advokat
er alltid avledede verker, og jeg mener ikke å gjøre noe mer i denne boken
enn å minne en kultur om en tradisjon som alltid har vært deres egen. Som
Stallman forsvarer jeg denne tradisjonen på grunnlag av verdier. Som
Stallman tror jeg dette er verdiene til frihet.  Og som Stallman, tror jeg
dette er verdier fra vår fortid som må forsvares i vår fremtid.  En fri
kultur har vært vår fortid, men vil bare være vår fremtid hvis vi endrer
retningen vi følger akkurat nå.  På samme måte som Stallmans argumenter for
fri programvare, treffer argumenter for en fri kultur på forvirring som er
vanskelig å unngå, og enda vanskeligere å forstå.  En fri kultur er ikke en
kultur uten eierskap. Det er ikke en kultur der kunstnere ikke får
betalt. En kultur uten eierskap eller en der skaperne ikke kan få betalt, er
anarki, ikke frihet.  Anarki er ikke hva jeg fremmer her.
</p><p>
I stedet er den frie kulturen som jeg forsvarer i denne boken en balanse
mellom anarki og kontroll.  En fri kultur, i likhet med et fritt marked, er
fylt med eierskap.  Den er fylt med regler for eierskap og kontrakter som
blir håndhevet av staten.  Men på samme måte som det frie markedet blir
pervertert hvis dets eierskap blir føydalt, så kan en fri kultur bli ødelagt
av ekstremisme i eierskapsrettighetene som definerer den.  Det er dette jeg
frykter om vår kultur i dag.  Det er som motpol til denne ekstremismen at
denne boken er skrevet.

17. desember 1903, på en vindfylt strand i Nord-Carolina i såvidt under
hundre sekunder, demonstrerte Wright-brødrene at et selvdrevet fartøy tyngre
enn luft kunne fly.  Øyeblikket var elektrisk, og dens betydning ble alment
forstått. Nesten umiddelbart, eksploderte interessen for denne nye
teknologien som muliggjorde bemannet luftfart og en hærskare av oppfinnere
begynte å bygge videre på den.
</p><p>
Da Wright-brødrene fant opp flymaskinen, hevdet loven i USA at en grunneier
ble antatt å eie ikke bare overflaten på området sitt, men også alt landet
under bakken, helt ned til senterpunktet i jorda, og alt volumet over
bakken, "i ubestemt grad, oppover".<sup>[<a name="id2628954" href="#ftn.id2628954" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup> I
mange år undret lærde over hvordan en best skulle tolke idéen om at
eiendomsretten gikk helt til himmelen. Betød dette at du eide stjernene?
Kunne en dømme gjess for at de regelmessig og med vilje tok seg inn på annen
manns eiendom?
</p><p>
Så kom flymaskiner, og for første gang hadde dette prinsippet i lovverket i
USA&#8212;dypt nede i grunnlaget for vår tradisjon og akseptert av de
viktigste juridiske tenkerne i vår fortid&#8212;en betydning. Hvis min
eiendom rekker til himmelen, hva skjer når United flyr over mitt område?
Har jeg rett til å nekte dem å bruke min eiendom?  Har jeg mulighet til å
inngå en eksklusiv avtale med Delta Airlines?  Kan vi gjennomføre en auksjon
for å finne ut hvor mye disse rettighetene er verdt?
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2683230"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2683255"></a><p>
I 1945 ble disse spørsmålene en føderal sak. Da bøndene Thomas Lee og Tinie
Causby i Nord Carolina begynte å miste kyllinger på grunn av lavtflygende
militære fly (vettskremte kyllinger fløy tilsynelatende i låveveggene og
døde), saksøkte Causbyene regjeringen for å trenge seg inn på deres
eiendom. Flyene rørte selvfølgelig aldri overflaten på Causbys' eiendom. Men
hvis det stemte som Blackstone, Kent, og Cola hadde sagt, at deres eiendom
strakk seg "i ubestemt grad, oppover," så hadde regjeringen trengt seg inn
på deres eiendom, og Causbys ønsket å sette en stopper for dette.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2683274"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2683280"></a><p>
Høyesterett gikk med på å ta opp Causbys sak. Kongressen hadde vedtatt at
luftfartsveiene var tilgjengelig for alle, men hvis ens eiendom virkelig
rakk til himmelen, da kunne muligens kongressens vedtak ha vært i strid med
grunnlovens forbud mot å "ta" eiendom uten kompensasjon.  Retten erkjente at
"det er gammel doktrine etter sedvane at en eiendom rakk til utkanten av
universet.", men dommer Douglas hadde ikke tålmodighet for forhistoriske
doktriner.  I et enkelt avsnitt, ble hundrevis av år med
eiendomslovgivningen strøket. Som han skrev på vegne av retten,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
[Denne] doktrinen har ingen plass i den moderne verden.  Luften er en
offentlig motorvei, slik kongressen har erklært.  Hvis det ikke var
tilfelle, ville hver eneste transkontinentale flyrute utsette operatørene
for utallige søksmål om inntrenging på annen manns eiendom.  Idéen er i
strid med sunn fornuft.  Å anerkjenne slike private krav til luftrommet
ville blokkere disse motorveiene, seriøst forstyrre muligheten til kontroll
og utvikling av dem i fellesskapets interesse og overføre til privat
eierskap det som kun fellesskapet har et rimelig krav til.<sup>[<a name="id2683318" href="#ftn.id2683318" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
"Idéen er i strid med sunn fornuft."
</p><p>

Det er hvordan loven vanligvis fungerer.  Ikke ofte like brått eller
utålmodig, men til slutt er dette hvordan loven fungerer.  Det var ikke
stilen til Douglas å utbrodere.  Andre dommere ville ha skrevet mange flere
sider før de nådde sin konklusjon, men for Douglas holdt det med en enkel
linje: "Idéen er i strid med sunn fornuft.".  Men uansett om det tar flere
sider eller kun noen få ord, så er det en genial egenskap med et
lovpraksis-system, slik som vårt er, at loven tilpasser seg til aktuelle
teknologiene.  Og mens den tilpasser seg, så endres den.  Idéer som var
solide som fjell i en tidsalder knuses i en annen.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2683383"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2683390"></a><p>
Eller, det er hvordan ting skjer når det ikke er noen mektige på andre siden
av endringen.  Causbyene var bare bønder.  Og selv om det uten tvil var
mange som dem som var lei av den økende trafikken i luften (og en håper ikke
for mange kyllinger flakset seg inn i vegger), ville Causbyene i verden
finne det svært hardt å samles for å stoppe idéen, og teknologien, som
Wright-brødrene hadde ført til verden.  Wright-brødrene spyttet flymaskiner
inn i den teknologiske meme-dammen. Idéen spredte seg deretter som et virus
i en kyllingfarm. Causbyene i verden fant seg selv omringet av "det synes
rimelig" gitt teknologien som Wright-brødrene hadde produsert.  De kunne stå
på sine gårder, med døde kyllinger i hendene, og heve knyttneven mot disse
nye teknologiene så mye de ville.  De kunne ringe sine representanter eller
til og med saksøke.  Men når alt kom til alt, ville kraften i det som virket
"åpenbart" for alle andre&#8212;makten til "sunn fornuft"&#8212;ville vinne
frem.  Deres "personlige interesser" ville ikke få lov til å nedkjempe en
åpenbar fordel for fellesskapet.
</p><p>
Edwin Howard Armstrong er en av USAs glemte oppfinnergenier. Han dukket opp
på oppfinnerscenen etter titaner som Thomas Edison og Alexander Graham
Bell.  Alle hans bidrag på området radioteknologi gjør han til kanskje den
viktigste av alle enkeltoppfinnere i de første femti årene av radio.  Han
var bedre utdannet enn Michael Faraday, som var bokbinderlærling da han
oppdaget elektrisk induksjon i 1831.  Men han hadde like god intuisjon om
hvordan radioverden virket, og ved minst tre anledninger, fant Armstrong opp
svært viktig teknologier som brakte vår forståelse av radio et hopp videre.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2683453"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2683462"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2683468"></a>
</p><p>
Dagen etter julaften i 1933, ble fire patenter utstedt til Armstrong for
hans mest signifikante oppfinnelse&#8212;FM-radio.  Inntil da hadde
forbrukerradioer vært amplitude-modulert (AM) radio.  Tidens teoretikere
hadde sagt at frekvens-modulert (FM) radio.  De hadde rett når det gjelder
et smalt bånd av spektrumet.  Men Armstrong oppdaget at frekvens-modulert
radio i et vidt bånd i spektrumet leverte en forbløffende gjengivelse av
lyd, med mye mindre senderstyrke og støy.
</p><p>
Den 5. november 1935 demonstrerte han teknologien på et møte hos institutt
for radioingeniører ved Empire State-bygningen i New York City.  Han vred
radiosøkeren over en rekke AM-stasjoner, inntil radioen låste seg mot en
kringkasting som han hadde satt opp 27 kilometer unna.  Radioen ble helt
stille, som om den var død, og så, med en klarhet ingen andre i rommet noen
gang hadde hørt fra et elektrisk apparat, produserte det lyden av en
opplesers stemme: "Dette er amatørstasjon W2AG ved Yonkers, New York, som
opererer på frekvensmodulering ved to og en halv meter."
</p><p>
Publikum hørte noe ingen hadde trodd var mulig:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Et glass vann ble fylt opp foran mikrofonen i Yonkers, og det hørtes ut som
et plass som ble fylt opp. . . . Et papir ble krøllet og revet opp, og det
hørtes ut som papir og ikke som en sprakende skogbrann. . . . Sousa-marsjer
ble spilt av fra plater og en pianosolo og et gitarnummer ble
utført. . . . Musikken ble presentert med en livaktighet som sjeldent om
noen gang før hadde vært hørt fra en radio-"musikk-boks".<sup>[<a name="id2683533" href="#ftn.id2683533" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>

Som vår egen sunn fornuft forteller oss, hadde Armstrong oppdaget en mye
bedre radioteknologi.  Men på tidspunktet for hans oppfinnelse, jobbet
Armstrong for RCA. RCA var den dominerende aktøren i det da dominerende
AM-radiomarkedet. I 1935 var det tusen radiostasjoner over hele USA, men
stasjonene i de store byene var alle eid av en liten håndfull selskaper.

</p><p>
Presidenten i RCA, David Sarnoff, en venn av Armstrong, var ivrig etter å få
Armstrong til å oppdage en måte å fjerne støyen fra AM-radio. Så Sarnoff var
ganske spent da Armstrong fortalte ham at han hadde en enhet som fjernet
støy fra "radio.".   Men da Armstrong demonstrerte sin oppfinnelse, var ikke
Sarnoff fornøyd.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2683574"></a>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Jeg trodde Armstrong ville finne opp et slags filter for å fjerne skurring
fra AM-radioen vår. Jeg trodde ikke han skulle starte en revolusjon &#8212;
starte en hel forbannet ny industri i konkurranse med RCA.<sup>[<a name="id2683481" href="#ftn.id2683481" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Armstrongs oppfinnelse truet RCAs AM-herredømme, så selskapet lanserte en
kampanje for å knuse FM-radio. Mens FM kan ha vært en overlegen teknologi,
var Sarnoff en overlegen taktiker. En forfatter beskrev det slik,
<a class="indexterm" name="id2683616"></a>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Kreftene til fordel for FM, i hovedsak ingeniørfaglige, kunne ikke overvinne
tyngden til strategien utviklet av avdelingene for salg, patenter og juss
for å undertrykke denne trusselen til selskapets posisjon.  For FM utgjorde,
hvis det fikk utvikle seg uten begrensninger . . . en komplett endring i
maktforholdene rundt radio . . . og muligens fjerningen av det nøye
begrensede AM-systemet som var grunnlaget for RCA stigning til
makt.<sup>[<a name="id2683639" href="#ftn.id2683639" class="footnote">8</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
RCA holdt først teknologien innomhus, og insistere på at det var nødvendig
med ytterligere tester. Da Armstrong, etter to år med testing, ble
utålmodig, begynte RCA å bruke sin makt hos myndighetene til holde tilbake
den generelle spredningen av FM-radio. I 1936, ansatte RCA den tidligere
lederen av FCC og ga ham oppgaven med å sikre at FCC tilordnet
radiospekteret på en måte som ville kastrere FM&#8212;hovedsakelig ved å
flytte FM-radio til et annet band i spekteret. I første omgang lyktes ikke
disse forsøkene.  Men mens Armstrong og nasjonen var distrahert av andre
verdenskrig, begynte RCAs arbeid å bære frukter.  Like etter at krigen var
over, annonserte FCC et sett med avgjørelser som ville ha en klar effekt:
FM-radio ville bli forkrøplet.Lawrence lessing beskrevet det slik,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Serien med slag mot kroppen som FM-radio mottok rett etter krigen, i en
serie med avgjørelser manipulert gjennom FCC av de store radiointeressene,
var nesten utrolige i deres kraft og underfundighet.<sup>[<a name="id2683655" href="#ftn.id2683655" class="footnote">9</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2683694"></a><p>
For å gjøre plass i spektrumet for RCAs nyeste satsingsområde, televisjon,
skulle FM-radioens brukere flyttes til et helt nytt band i spektrumet.
Sendestyrken til FM-radioene ble også redusert, og gjorde at FM ikke lenger
kunne brukes for å sende programmer fra en del av landet til en annen.
(Denne endringen ble sterkt støttet av AT&amp;T, på grunn av at fjerningen
av FM-videresendingsstasjoner ville bety at radiostasjonene ville bli nødt
til å kjøpe kablede linker fra AT&amp;T.)  Spredningen av FM-radio var
dermed kvalt, i hvert fall midlertidig.
</p><p>
Armstrong sto imot RCAs innsats. Som svar motsto RCA Armstrongs patenter.
Etter å ha bakt FM-teknologi inn i den nye standarden for TV, erklærte RCS
patentene ugyldige&#8212;uten grunn og nesten femten år etter at de ble
utstedet.  De nektet dermed å betale ham for bruken av patentene.  I seks år
kjempet Armstrong en dyr søksmålskrig for å forsvare patentene sine.  Til
slutt, samtidig som patentene utløp, tilbød RCA et forlik så lavt at det
ikke engang dekket Armstrongs advokatregning.  Beseiret, knust og nå blakk,
skrev Armstrong i 1954 en kort beskjed til sin kone, før han gikk ut av et
vindu i trettende etasje og falt i døden.
</p><p>

Dette er slik loven virker noen ganger.  Ikke ofte like tragisk, og sjelden
med heltemodig drama, men noen ganger er det slik det virker. Fra starten
har myndigheter og myndighetsorganer blitt tatt til fange. Det er mer
sannsynlig at de blir fanget når en mektig interesse er truet av enten en
juridisk eller teknologisk endring.  Denne mektige interessen utøver for
ofte sin innflytelse hos myndighetene til å få myndighetene til å beskytte
den.  Retorikken for denne beskyttelsen er naturligvis alltid med fokus på
fellesskapets beste.  Realiteten er noe annet.  Idéer som kan være solide
som fjell i en tidsalder, men som overlatt til seg selv, vil falle sammen i
en annen, er videreført gjennom denne subtile korrupsjonen i vår politiske
prosess.  RCA hadde hva Causby-ene ikke hadde: Makten til å undertrykke
effekten av en teknologisk endring.
</p><p>
Det er ingen enkeltoppfinner av Internet.  Ei heller er det en god dato som
kan brukes til å markere når det ble født.  Likevel har internettet i løpet
av svært kort tid blitt en del av vanlige amerikaneres liv.  I følge the Pew
Internet and American Life-prosjektet, har 58 prosent av amerikanerne hatt
tilgang til internettet i 2002, opp fra 49 prosent to år
tidligere.<sup>[<a name="id2683774" href="#ftn.id2683774" class="footnote">10</a>]</sup> Det tallet kan uten
problemer passere to tredjedeler av nasjonen ved utgangen av 2004.
</p><p>
Etter hvert som internett er blitt integrert inn i det vanlige liv har ting
blitt endret.  Noen av disse endringene er teknisk&#8212;internettet har
gjort kommunikasjon raskere, det har redusert kostnaden med å samle inn
data, og så videre.  Disse tekniske endringene er ikke fokus for denne
boken.  De er viktige.  De er ikke godt forstått.  Men de er den type ting
som ganske enkelt ville blir borte hvis vi alle bare slo av internettet.  De
påvirker ikke folk som ikke bruker internettet, eller i det miste påvirker
det ikke dem direkte.  De er et godt tema for en bok om internettet.  Men
dette er ikke en bok om internettet.
</p><p>
I stedet er denne boken om effekten av internettet ut over internettet i seg
selv.  En effekt på hvordan kultur blir skapt.  Min påstand er at
internettet har ført til en viktig og ukjent endring i denne prosessen.
Denne endringen vil forandre en tradisjon som er like gammel som republikken
selv.  De fleste, hvis de la merke til denne endringen, ville avvise den.
Men de fleste legger ikke engang merke til denne endringen som internettet
har introdusert.
</p><p>

Vi kan få en følelse av denne endringen ved å skille mellom kommersiell og
ikke-kommersiell kultur, ved å knytte lovens reguleringer til hver av dem.
Med "kommersiell kultur" mener jeg den delen av vår kultur som er produsert
og solgt eller produsert for å bli solgt.  Med "ikke-kommersiell kultur"
mener jeg alt det andre. Da gamle menn satt rundt i parker eller på
gatehjørner og fortalte historier som unger og andre lyttet til, så var det
ikke-kommersiell kultur.  Da Noah Webster publiserte sin "Reader", eller
Joel Barlow sin poesi, så var det kommersiell kultur.
</p><p>
Fra historisk tid, og for omtrent hele vår tradisjon, har ikke-kommersiell
kultur i hovedsak ikke vært regulert.  Selvfølgelig, hvis din historie var
utuktig, eller hvis dine sanger forstyrret freden, kunne loven gripe inn.
Men loven var aldri direkte interessert i skapingen eller spredningen av
denne form for kultur, og lot denne kulturen være "fri".  Den vanlige måten
som vanlige individer delte og formet deres kultur&#8212;historiefortelling,
formidling av scener fra teater eller TV, delta i fan-klubber, deling av
musikk, laging av kassetter&#8212;ble ikke styrt av lovverket.
</p><p>
Fokuset på loven var kommersiell kreativitet.  I starten forsiktig, etter
hvert betraktelig, beskytter loven insentivet til skaperne ved å tildele dem
en eksklusiv rett til deres kreative verker, slik at de kan selge disse
eksklusive rettighetene på en kommersiell markedsplass.<sup>[<a name="id2683868" href="#ftn.id2683868" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup> Dette er også, naturligvis, en viktig del av
kreativitet og kultur, og det har blitt en viktigere og viktigere del i
USA.  Men det var på ingen måte dominerende i vår tradisjon.  Det var i
stedet bare en del, en kontrollert del, balansert mot det frie.
</p><p>
Denne grove inndelingen mellom den frie og den kontrollerte har nå blitt
fjernet.<sup>[<a name="id2683904" href="#ftn.id2683904" class="footnote">12</a>]</sup> Internettet har satt scenen
for denne fjerningen, og pressen frem av store medieaktører har loven nå
påvirket det.  For første gang i vår tradisjon, har de vanlige måtene som
individer skaper og deler kultur havnet innen rekekvidde for reguleringene
til loven, som har blitt utvidet til å dra inn i sitt kontrollområde den
enorme mengden kultur og kreativitet som den aldri tidligere har nådd over.
Teknologien som tok vare på den historiske balansen&#8212;mellom bruken av
den delen av kulturen vår som var fri og bruken av vår kultur som krevde
tillatelse&#8212;har blitt borte.  Konsekvensen er at vi er mindre og mindre
en fri kultur, og mer og mer en tillatelseskultur.
</p><p>
Denne endringen blir rettferdiggjort som nødvendig for å beskytte
kommersiell kreativitet.  Og ganske riktig, proteksjonisme er nøyaktig det
som motiverer endringen.  Men proteksjonismen som rettferdiggjør endringene
som jeg skal beskrive lenger ned er ikke den begrensede og balanserte typen
som har definert loven tidligere.  Dette er ikke en proteksjonisme for å
beskytte artister.  Det er i stedet en proteksjonisme for å beskytte
bestemte forretningsformer.  Selskaper som er truet av potensialet til
internettet for å endre måten både kommersiell og ikke-kommersiell kultur
blir skapt og delt, har samlet seg for å få lovgiverne til å bruke loven for
å beskytte selskapene.  Dette er historien om RCA og Armstrong, og det er
drømmen til Causbyene.
</p><p>
For internettet har sluppet løs en ekstraordinær mulighet for mange til å
delta i prosessen med å bygge og kultivere en kultur som rekker lagt utenfor
lokale grenselinjer.  Den makten har endret markedsplassen for å lage og
kultivere kultur generelt, og den endringen truer i neste omgang etablerte
innholdsindustrier. Internettet er dermed for industriene som bygget og
distribuerte innhold i det tjuende århundret hva FM-radio var for AM-radio,
eller hva traileren var for jernbaneindustrien i det nittende århundret:
begynnelsen på slutten, eller i hvert fall en markant endring. Digitale
teknologier, knyttet til internettet, kunne produsere et mye mer
konkurransedyktig og levende marked for å bygge og kultivere kultur.  Dette
markedet kunne inneholde en mye videre og mer variert utvalg av skapere.
Disse skaperne kunne produsere og distribuere et mye mer levende utvalg av
kreativitet. Og avhengig av noen få viktige faktorer, så kunne disse
skaperne tjenere mer i snitt fra dette systemet enn skaperne gjør i
dag&#8212;så lenge RCA-ene av i dag ikke bruker loven til å beskytte dem
selv mot denne konkurransen.
</p><p>
Likevel, som jeg argumenterer for i sidene som følger, er dette nøyaktig det
som skjer i vår kultur i dag.  Dette som er dagens ekvivalenter til tidlig
tjuende århundres radio og nittende århundres jernbaner bruker deres makt
til å få loven til å beskytte dem mot dette nye, mer effektive, mer levende
teknologi for å bygge kultur. De lykkes i deres plan om å gjøre om
internettet før internettet gjør om på dem.
</p><p>
Det ser ikke slik ut for mange.  Kamphandlingene over opphavsrett og
internettet er fjernt for de fleste.  For de få som følger dem, virker de i
hovedsak å handle om et enklere sett med spørsmål&#8212;hvorvidt
"piratvirksomhet" vil bli akseptert, og hvorvidt "eiendomsretten" vil bli
beskyttet.  "Krigen" som har blitt erklært mot teknologiene til
internettet&#8212;det presidenten for Motion Picture Association of America
(MPAA) Jack Valenti kaller sin "egen terroristkrig"<sup>[<a name="id2684032" href="#ftn.id2684032" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup>&#8212;har blitt rammet inn som en kamp om å følge
loven og respektere eiendomsretten.  For å vite hvilken side vi bør ta i
denne krigen, de fleste tenker at vi kun trenger å bestemme om hvorvidt vi
er for eiendomsrett eller mot den.
</p><p>
Hvis dette virkelig var alternativene, så ville jeg være enig med Jack
Valenti og innholdsindustrien.  Jeg tror også på eiendomsretten, og spesielt
på viktigheten av hva Mr. Valenti så pent kaller "kreativ eiendomsrett".
Jeg tror at "piratvirksomhet" er galt, og at loven, riktig innstilt, bør
straffe "piratvirksomhet", både på og utenfor internettet.
</p><p>
Men disse enkle trosoppfatninger maskerer et mye mer grunnleggende spørsmål
og en mye mer dramatisk endring. Min frykt er at med mindre vi begynner å
legge merke til denne endringen, så vil krigen for å befri verden fra
internettets "pirater" også fjerne verdier fra vår kultur som har vært
integrert til vår tradisjon helt fra starten.
</p><p>
Disse verdiene bygget en tradisjon som, for i hvert fall de første 180 årene
av vår republikk, garanterte skaperne rettigheten til å bygge fritt på deres
fortid, og beskyttet skaperne og innovatørene fra både statlig og privat
kontroll.  Det første grunnlovstillegget beskyttet skaperne fra statlig
kontroll.  Og som professor Neil Netanel kraftfylt argumenterer,<sup>[<a name="id2684097" href="#ftn.id2684097" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup> opphavsrettslov, skikkelig balansert, beskyttet
skaperne mot privat kontroll.  Vår tradisjon var dermed hverken Sovjet eller
tradisjonen til velgjørere.  I stedet skar det ut en bred manøvreringsrom
hvor skapere kunne kultivere og utvide vår kultur.
</p><p>
Likevel har lovens respons til internettet, når det knyttes sammen til
endringer i teknologien i internettet selv, ført til massiv økting av den
effektive reguleringen av kreativitet i USA.  For å bygge på eller kritisere
kulturen rundt oss må en spørre, som Oliver Twist, om tillatelse først.
Tillatelse er, naturligvis, ofte innvilget&#8212;men det er ikke ofte
innvilget til den kritiske eller den uavhengige.  Vi har bygget en slags
kulturell adel.  De innen dette adelskapet har et enkelt liv, mens de på
utsiden har det ikke.  Men det er adelskap i alle former som er fremmed for
vår tradisjon.
</p><p>
Historien som følger er om denne krigen.  Er det ikke om "betydningen av
teknologi" i vanlig liv.  Jeg tror ikke på guder, hverken digitale eller
andre typer.  Det er heller ikke et forsøk på å demonisere noen individer
eller gruppe, jeg tro heller ikke i en djevel, selskapsmessig eller på annen
måte.  Det er ikke en moralsk historie.  Ei heller er det et rop om hellig
krig mot en industri.
</p><p>
Det er i stedet et forsøk på å forstå en håpløst ødeleggende krig som er
inspirert av teknologiene til internettet, men som rekker lang utenfor dens
kode.  Og ved å forstå denne kampen er den en innsats for å finne veien til
fred.  Det er ingen god grunn for å fortsette dagens batalje rundt
internett-teknologiene.  Det vil være til stor skade for vår tradisjon og
kultur hvis den får lov til å fortsette ukontrollert. Vi må forstå kilden
til denne krigen.  Vi må finne en løsning snart.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2684180"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2684185"></a><p>
Lik Causbyenes kamp er denne krigen, delvis, om "eiendomsrett". Eiendommen i
denne krigen er ikke like håndfast som den til Causbyene, og ingen uskyldige
kyllinger har så langt mistet livet.  Likevel er idéene rundt denne
"eiendomsretten" like åpenbare for de fleste som Causbyenes krav om
ukrenkeligheten til deres bondegård var for dem. De fleste av oss tar for
gitt de uvanlig mektige krav som eierne av "immaterielle rettigheter" nå
hevder.  De fleste av oss, som Causbyene, behandler disse kravene som
åpenbare.  Og dermed protesterer vi, som Causbyene,, når ny teknologi griper
inn i denne eiendomsretten.  Det er så klart for oss som det var fro dem at
de nye teknologiene til internettet "tar seg til rette" mot legitime krav
til "eiendomsrett".  Det er like klart for oss som det var for dem at loven
skulle ta affære for å stoppe denne inntrengingen i annen manns eiendom.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2684228"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2684234"></a><p>

Og dermed, når nerder og teknologer forsvarer sin tids Armstrong og
Wright-brødenes teknologi, får de lite sympati fra de fleste av oss. Sunn
fornuft gjør ikke opprør.  I motsetning til saken til de uheldige Causbyene,
er sunn fornuft på samme side som eiendomseierne i denne krigen.  I
motsetning til hos de heldige Wright-brødrene, har internettet ikke
inspirert en revolusjon til fordel for seg.
</p><p>
Mitt håp er å skyve denne sunne fornuften videre.  Jeg har blitt stadig mer
overrasket over kraften til denne idéen om immaterielle rettigheter og, mer
viktig, dets evne til å slå av kritisk tanke hos lovmakere og innbyggere.
Det har aldri før i vår historie vært så mye av vår "kultur" som har vært
"eid" enn det er nå.  Og likevel har aldri før konsentrasjonen av makt til å
kontrollere <span class="emphasis"><em>bruken</em></span> av kulturen vært mer akseptert uten
spørsmål enn det er nå.
</p><p>
Gåten er, hvorfor det?  Er det fordi vi fått en innsikt i sannheten om
verdien og betydningen av absolutt eierskap over idéer og kultur? Er det
fordi vi har oppdaget at vår tradisjon med å avvise slike absolutte krav var
feil?
</p><p>
Eller er det på grunn av at idéer om absolutt eierskap over idéer og kultur
gir fordeler til RCA-ene i vår tid, og passer med vår ureflekterte
intuisjon?
</p><p>
Er denne radikale endringen vekk fra vår tradisjon om fri kultur en
forekomst av USA som korrigerer en feil fra sin fortid, slik vi gjorde det
etter en blodig krig mot slaveri, og slik vi sakte gjør det mot
forskjellsbehandling?  Eller er denne radikale endringen vekk fra vår
tradisjon med fri kultur nok et eksempel på at vårt politiske system er
fanget av noen få mektige særinteresser?
</p><p>
Fører sunn fornuft til det ekstreme i dette spørsmålet på grunn av at sunn
fornuft faktisk tror på dette ekstreme?  Eller står sunn fornuft i stillhet
i møtet med dette ekstreme fordi, som med Armstrong versus RCA, at den mer
mektige siden har sikret seg at det har et mye mer mektig synspunkt?
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2684324"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2684330"></a><p>

Jeg forsøker ikke å være mystisk.  Mine egne synspunkter er klare. Jeg mener
det var riktig for sunn fornuft å gjøre opprør mot ekstremismen til
Causbyene.  Jeg mener det ville være riktig for sunn fornuft å gjøre opprør
mot de ekstreme krav som gjøres i dag på vegne av "immaterielle
rettigheter".  Det som loven krever i dag er mer å mer like dumt som om
lensmannen skulle arrestere en flymaskin for å trenge inn på annen manns
eiendom.  Men konsekvensene av den nye dumskapen vil bli mye mer
dyptgripende.

</p><p>
Basketaket som pågår akkurat nå senterer seg rundt to idéer:
"piratvirksomhet" og "eiendom".  Mitt mål med denne bokens neste to deler er
å utforske disse to idéene.
</p><p>
Metoden min er ikke den vanlige metoden for en akademiker.  Jeg ønsker ikke
å pløye deg inn i et komplisert argument, steinsatt med referanser til
obskure franske teoretikere&#8212;uansett hvor naturlig det har blitt for
den rare sorten vi akademikere har blitt.  Jeg vil i stedet begynne hver del
med en samling historier som etablerer en sammenheng der disse
tilsynelatende enkle idéene kan bli fullt ut forstått.
</p><p>
De to delene setter opp kjernen i påstanden til denne boken: at mens
internettet faktisk har produsert noe fantastisk og nytt, bidrar våre
myndigheter, presset av store medieaktører for å møte dette "noe nytt" til å
ødelegge noe som er svært gammelt.  I stedet for å forstå endringene som
internettet kan gjøre mulig, og i stedet for å ta den tiden som trengs for å
la "sunn fornuft" finne ut hvordan best svare på utfordringen, så lar vi de
som er mest truet av endringene bruke sin makt til å endre loven&#8212;og
viktigere, å bruke sin makt til å endre noe fundamentalt om hvordan vi
alltid har fungert.
</p><p>
Jeg tror vi tillater dette, ikke fordi det er riktig, og heller ikke fordi
de fleste av oss tror på disse endringene.  Vi tillater det på grunn av at
de interessene som er mest truet er blant de mest mektige aktørene i vår
deprimerende kompromitterte prosess for å utforme lover. Denne boken er
historien om nok en konsekvens for denne type korrupsjon&#8212;en konsekvens
for de fleste av oss forblir ukjent med.

Dette er ikke det eneste formålet med opphavsrett, men det er helt klart
hovedformålet med opphavsretten slik den er etablert i føderal grunnlov.
Opphavsrettslovene i delstatene beskyttet historisk ikke bare kommersielle
interesse når det gjaldt publikasjoner, men også personverninteresser.  Ved
å gi forfattere eneretten til å publisere først, ga delstatenes
opphavsrettslovene forfatterne makt til å kontrollere spredningen av fakta
om seg selv. Se Samuel D. Warren og Louis Brandeis, "The Right to Privacy",

Helt siden loven begynte å regulere kreative eierrettigheter, har det vært
en krig mot "piratvirksomhet".  De presise konturene av dette konseptet,
"piratvirksomhet", har vært vanskelig å tegne opp, men bildet av
urettferdighet er enkelt å beskrive.  Som Lord Mansfield skrev i en sak som
utvidet rekkevidden for engelsk opphavsrettslov til å inkludere noteark,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
En person kan bruke kopien til å spille den, men han har ingen rett til å
robbe forfatteren for profitten, ved å lage flere kopier og distribuere
etter eget forgodtbefinnende.<sup>[<a name="id2684466" href="#ftn.id2684466" class="footnote">15</a>]</sup>
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2684480"></a></blockquote></div><p>

I dag er vi midt inne i en annen "krig" mot "piratvirksomhet". Internettet
har fremprovosert denne krigen.  Internettet gjør det mulig å effektivt spre
innhold.  Peer-to-peer (p2p) fildeling er blant det mest effektive av de
effektive teknologier internettet muliggjør. Ved å bruke distribuert
intelligens, kan p2p-systemer muliggjøre enkel spredning av innhold på en
måte som ingen forestilte seg for en generasjon siden.

</p><p>
Denne effektiviteten respekterer ikke de tradisjonelle skillene i
opphavsretten. Nettverket skiller ikke mellom deling av
opphavsrettsbeskyttet og ikke opphavsrettsbeskyttet innhold. Dermed har det
vært deling av en enorm mengde opphavsrettsbeskyttet innhold.  Denne
delingen har i sin tur ansporet til krigen, på grunn av at eiere av
opphavsretter frykter delingen vil "frata forfatteren overskuddet."
</p><p>
Krigerne har snudd seg til domstolene, til lovgiverne, og i stadig større
grad til teknologi for å forsvare sin "eiendom" mot denne
"piratvirksomheten".  En generasjon amerikanere, advarer krigerne, blir
oppdratt til å tro at "eiendom" skal være "gratis".  Glem tatoveringer, ikke
tenk på kroppspiercing&#8212;våre barn blir <span class="emphasis"><em>tyver</em></span>!
</p><p>
Det er ingen tvil om at "piratvirksomhet" er galt, og at pirater bør
straffes.  Men før vi roper på bødlene, bør vi sette dette
"piratvirksomhets"-begrepet i en sammenheng.  For mens begrepet blir mer og
mer brukt, har det i sin kjerne en ekstraordinær idé som nesten helt sikkert
er feil.
</p><p>
Idéen høres omtrent slik ut:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Kreativt arbeid har verdi.  Når jeg bruker, eller tar, eller bygger på det
kreative arbeidet til andre, så tar jeg noe fra dem som har verdi.  Når jeg
tar noe av verdi fra noen andre, bør jeg få tillatelse fra dem.  Å ta noe
som har verdi fra andre uten tillatelse er galt.  Det er en form for
piratvirksomhet.
</p></blockquote></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2684579"></a><p>
Dette synet går dypt i de pågående debattene.  Det er hva jussprofessor
Rochelle Dreyfuss ved NYU kritiserer som "hvis verdi, så rettighet"-teorien
for kreative eierrettigheter <sup>[<a name="id2684594" href="#ftn.id2684594" class="footnote">16</a>]</sup>&#8212;hvis det finnes verdi, så må noen ha rettigheten til denne
verdien.  Det er perspektivet som fikk komponistenes rettighetsorganisasjon,
ASCAP, til å saksøke jentespeiderne for å ikke betale for sangene som
jentene sagt rundt jentespeidernes leirbål.<sup>[<a name="id2684614" href="#ftn.id2684614" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup> Det fantes "verdi" (sangene), så det måtte ha vært en
"rettighet"&#8212;til og med mot jentespeiderne.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2684642"></a><p>

Denne idéen er helt klart en mulig forståelse om hvordan kreative
eierrettigheter bør virke.  Det er helt klart et mulig design for et
lovsystem som beskytter kreative eierrettigheter.  Men teorien om "hvis
verdi, så rettighet" for kreative eierrettigheter har aldri vært USAs teori
for kreative eierrettigheter.  It har aldri stått rot i vårt lovverk.
</p><p>
I vår tradisjon har immaterielle rettigheter i stedet vært et instrument.
Det bygger fundamentet for et rikt kreativt samfunn, men er fortsatt servilt
til verdien av kreativitet.  Dagens debatt har snudd dette helt rundt.  Vi
har blitt så opptatt av å beskytte instrumentet at vi mister verdien av
syne.
</p><p>
Kilden til denne forvirringen er et skille som loven ikke lenger bryr seg om
å markere&#8212;skillet mellom å gjenpublisere noens verk på den ene siden,
og bygge på og gjøre om verket på den andre.  Da opphavsretten kom var det
kun publisering som ble berørt. Opphavsretten i dag regulerer begge.
</p><p>
Før teknologiene til internettet dukket opp, betød ikke denne begrepsmessige
sammenblandingen mye.  Teknologiene for å publisere var kostbare, som betød
at det meste av publisering var kommersiell. Kommersielle aktører kunne
håndtere byrden pålagt av loven&#8212;til og med byrden som den bysantiske
kompleksiteten som opphavsrettsloven har blitt.  Det var bare nok en kostnad
ved å drive forretning.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2684696"></a><p>
Men da internettet dukket opp, forsvant denne naturlige begrensningen til
lovens virkeområde.  Loven kontrollerer ikke bare kreativiteten til
kommersielle skapere, men effektivt sett kreativiteten til alle. Selv om
utvidelsen ikke ville bety stort hvis opphavsrettsloven kun regulerte
"kopiering", så betyr utvidelsen mye når loven regulerer så bredt og obskurt
som den gjør.  Byrden denne loven gir oppveier nå langt fordelene den ga da
den ble vedtatt&#8212;helt klart slik den påvirker ikke-kommersiell
kreativitet, og i stadig større grad slik den påvirker kommersiell
kreativitet.  Dermed, slik vi ser klarere i kapitlene som følger, er lovens
rolle mindre og mindre å støtte kreativitet, og mer og mer å beskytte
enkelte industrier mot konkurranse.  Akkurat på tidspunktet da digital
teknologi kunne sluppet løs en ekstraordinær mengde med kommersiell og
ikke-kommersiell kreativitet, tynger loven denne kreativiteten med sinnsykt
kompliserte og vage regler og med trusselen om uanstendig harde straffer.
Vi ser kanskje, som Richard Florida skriver, "Fremveksten av den kreative
klasse"<sup>[<a name="id2684705" href="#ftn.id2684705" class="footnote">18</a>]</sup> Dessverre ser vi også en
ekstraordinær fremvekst av reguleringer av denne kreative klassen.
</p><p>
Disse byrdene gir ingen mening i vår tradisjon.  Vi bør begynne med å forstå
den tradisjonen litt mer, og ved å plassere dagens slag om oppførsel med
merkelappen "piratvirksomhet" i sin rette sammenheng.

I <em class="citetitle">The Rise of the Creative Class</em> (New York: Basic
Books, 2002), dokumenterer Richard Florida en endring i arbeidsstokken mot
kreativitetsarbeide.  Hans tekst omhandler derimot ikke direkte de juridiske
vilkår som kreativiteten blir muliggjort eller hindret under.  Jeg er helt
klart enig med ham i viktigheten og betydningen av denne endringen, men jeg
tror også at vilkårene som disse endringene blir aktivert under er mye
vanskeligere.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2684769"></a>

I 1928 ble en tegnefilmfigur født.  En tidlig Mikke Mus debuterte i mai
dette året, i en stille flopp ved navn <em class="citetitle">Plane Crazy</em>.
I november, i Colony teateret i New York City, ble den første vidt
distribuerte tegnefilmen med synkronisert lyd, <em class="citetitle">Steamboat
Willy</em>, vist frem med figuren som skulle bli til Mikke Mus.
</p><p>
Film med synkronisert lyd hadde blitt introdusert et år tidligere i filmen
<em class="citetitle">The Jazz Singer</em>.  Suksessen fikk Walt Disney til å
kopiere teknikken og mikse lyd med tegnefilm.  Ingen visste hvorvidt det
ville virke eller ikke, og om det fungere, hvorvidt publikum villa ha sans
for det.  Men da Disney gjorde en test sommeren 1928, var resultatet
entydig.  Som Disney beskriver dette første eksperimentet,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

Et par av guttene mine kunne lese noteark, og en av dem kunne spille
munnspill.  Vi stappet dem inn i et rom hvor de ikke kunne se skjermen, og
gjorde det slik at lyden de spilte ble sendt videre til et rom hvor våre
koner og venner var plassert for å se på bildet.

</p><p>
Guttene brukte et note- og lydeffekt-ark.  Etter noen dårlige oppstarter,
kom endelig lyd og handling i gang med et smell. Munnspilleren spilte
melodien, og resten av oss i lydavdelingen slamret på tinnkasseroller og
blåste på slide-fløyte til rytmen. Synkroniseringen var nesten helt riktig.
</p><p>
Effekten på vårt lille publikum var intet mindre enn elektrisk.  De reagerte
nesten instinktivt til denne union av lyd og bevegelse.  Jeg trodde de
tullet med meg.  Så de puttet meg i publikum og satte igang på nytt.  Det
var grufullt, men det var fantastisk.  Og det var noe nytt!<sup>[<a name="id2684884" href="#ftn.id2684884" class="footnote">19</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Disneys daværende partner, og en av animasjonsverdenens mest ekstraordinære
talenter, Ub Iwerks, uttalte det sterkere: "Jeg har aldri vært så begeistret
i hele mitt liv. Ingenting annet har noen sinne vært like bra." <a class="indexterm" name="id2684906"></a>
</p><p>
Disney hadde laget noe helt nyt, basert på noe relativt nytt. Synkronisert
lyd ga liv til en form for kreativitet som sjeldent hadde&#8212;unntatt fra
Disneys hender&#8212;vært noe annet en fyllstoff for andre filmer.  Gjennom
animasjonens tidligere historie var det Disneys oppfinnelse som satte
standarden som andre måtte sloss for å oppfylle.  Og ganske ofte var Disneys
store geni, hans gnist av kreativitet, bygget på arbeidet til andre.
</p><p>
Dette er kjent stoff.  Det du kanskje ikke vet er at 1928 også markerer en
annen viktig overgang.  I samme år laget et komedie-geni (i motsetning til
tegnefilm-geni) sin siste uavhengig produserte stumfilm.  Dette geniet var
Buster Keaton.  Filmen var <em class="citetitle">Steamboat Bill, Jr</em>.
</p><p>
Keaton ble født inn i en vauderville-familie i 1895.  I stumfilm-æraen hadde
han mestret bruken av bredpenslet fysisk komedie på en måte som tente
ukontrollerbar latter fra hans publikum. <em class="citetitle">Steamboat Bill,
Jr</em>. var en klassiker av denne typen, berømt blant film-elskere
for sine utrolige stunts.  Filmen var en klassisk Keaton&#8212;fantastisk
populær og blant de beste i sin sjanger.
</p><p>
<em class="citetitle">Steamboat Bill, Jr</em>. kom før Disneys tegnefilm
Steamboat Willie.  Det er ingen tilfeldighet at titlene er så
like. Steamboat Willie er en direkte tegneserieparodi av Steamboat
Bill,<sup>[<a name="id2684978" href="#ftn.id2684978" class="footnote">20</a>]</sup> og begge bygger på en felles sang
som kilde.  Det er ikke kun fra nyskapningen med synkronisert lyd i
<em class="citetitle">The Jazz Singer</em> at vi får <em class="citetitle">Steamboat
Willie</em>.  Det er også fra Buster Keatons nyskapning Steamboat
Bill, Jr., som igjen var inspirert av sangen "Steamboat Bill", at vi får
Steamboat Willie.  Og fra Steamboat Willie får vi så Mikke Mus.
</p><p>
Denne "låningen" var ikke unik, hverken for Disney eller for industrien.
Disney apet alltid etter full-lengde massemarkedsfilmene rundt
ham.<sup>[<a name="id2685031" href="#ftn.id2685031" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup> Det samme gjorde mange andre.
Tidlige tegnefilmer er stappfulle av etterapninger&#8212;små variasjoner
over suksessfulle temaer, gamle historier fortalt på nytt.  Nøkkelen til
suksess var brilliansen i forskjellene.  Med Disney var det lyden som ga
gnisten til hans animasjoner.  Senere var det kvaliteten på hans arbeide
relativt til de masseproduserte tegnefilmene som han konkurrerte med.
Likevel var disse bidragene bygget på toppen av fundamentet som var lånt.
Disney bygget på arbeidet til andre som kom før han, og skapte noe nytt ut
av noe som bare var litt gammelt.
</p><p>
Noen ganger var låningen begrenset, og noen ganger var den betydelig. Tenkt
på eventyrene til brødrene Grimm.  Hvis du er like ubevisst som jeg var, så
tror du sannsynlighvis at disse fortellingene er glade, søte historier som
passer for ethvert barn ved leggetid.  Realiteten er at Grimm-eventyrene er,
for oss, ganske dystre.  Det er noen sjeldne og kanskje spesielt ambisiøse
foreldre som ville våge å lese disse blodige moralistiske historiene til
sine barn, ved leggetid eller hvilken som helst annet tidspunkt.
</p><p>

Disney tok disse historiene og fortalte dem på nytt på en måte som førte dem
inn i en ny tidsalder. Han ga historiene liv, med både karakterer og
lys. Uten å fjerne bitene av frykt og fare helt, gjorde han morsomt det som
var mørkt og satte inn en ekte følelse av medfølelse der det før var
frykt. Og ikke bare med verkene av brødrene Grimm.  Faktisk er katalogen
over Disney-arbeid som baserer seg på arbeidet til andre ganske forbløffende
når den blir samlet: <em class="citetitle">Snøhvit</em> (1937),
<em class="citetitle">Fantasia</em> (1940), <em class="citetitle">Pinocchio</em>
(1940), <em class="citetitle">Dumbo</em> (1941), <em class="citetitle">Bambi</em>
(1942), <em class="citetitle">Song of the South</em> (1946),
<em class="citetitle">Askepott</em> (1950), <em class="citetitle">Alice in
Wonderland</em> (1951), <em class="citetitle">Robin Hood</em> (1952),
<em class="citetitle">Peter Pan</em> (1953), <em class="citetitle">Lady og
landstrykeren</em> (1955), <em class="citetitle">Mulan</em> (1998),
<em class="citetitle">Tornerose</em> (1959), <em class="citetitle">101
dalmatinere</em> (1961), <em class="citetitle">Sverdet i steinen</em>
(1963), og <em class="citetitle">Jungelboken</em> (1967)&#8212;for ikke å nevne
et nylig eksempel som vi bør kanskje glemme raskt, <em class="citetitle">Treasure
Planet</em> (2003). I alle disse tilfellene, har Disney (eller
Disney, Inc.) hentet kreativitet fra kultur rundt ham, blandet med
kreativiteten fra sitt eget ekstraordinære talent, og deretter brent denne
blandingen inn i sjelen til sin kultur. Hente, blande og brenne.
</p><p>
Dette er en type kreativitet.  Det er en kreativitet som vi bør huske på og
feire.  Det er noen som vil si at det finnes ingen kreativitet bortsett fra
denne typen.  Vi trenger ikke gå så langt for å anerkjenne dens betydning.
Vi kan kalle dette "Disney-kreativitet", selv om det vil være litt
misvisende.  Det er mer presist "Walt Disney-kreativitet"&#8212;en
uttrykksform og genialitet som bygger på kulturen rundt oss og omformer den
til noe annet.
</p><p> I 1928 var kulturen som Disney fritt kunne trekke veksler på relativt
fersk.  Allemannseie i 1928 var ikke veldig gammelt og var dermed ganske
levende.  Gjennomsnittelig vernetid i opphavsretten var bare rundt tredve
år&#8212;for den lille delen av kreative verk som faktisk var
opphavsrettsbeskyttet.<sup>[<a name="id2685173" href="#ftn.id2685173" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup> Det betyr at i
tredve år, i gjennomsnitt, hadde forfattere eller kreative verks
opphavsrettighetsinnehaver en "eksklusiv rett" til a kontrollere bestemte
typer bruk av verket.  For å bruke disse opphavsrettsbeskyttede verkene på
de begrensede måtene krevde tillatelse fra opphavsrettsinnehaveren.
</p><p>
Når opphavsrettens vernetid er over, faller et verk i det fri og blir
allemannseie.  Ingen tillatelse trengs da for å bygge på eller bruke dette
verket.  Ingen tillatelse og dermed, ingen advokater. Allemannseie er en
"advokat-fri sone".  Det meste av innhold fra det nittende århundre var
dermed fritt tilgjengelig for Disney å bruke eller bygge på i 1928.  Det var
tilgjengelig for enhver&#8212;uansett om de hadde forbindelser eller ikke,
om de var rik eller ikke, om de var akseptert eller ikke&#8212;til å bruke
og bygge videre på.
</p><p>

Dette er slik det alltid har vært&#8212;inntil ganske nylig.  For
mesteparten av vår historie, har allemannseiet vært like over horisonten.
Fram til 1978 var den gjennomsnittlige opphavsrettslige vernetiden aldri mer
enn trettito år, som gjorde at det meste av kultur fra en og en halv
generasjon tidligere var tilgjengelig for enhver å bygge på uten tillatelse
fra noen.  Tilsvarende for i dag ville være at kreative verker fra 1960- og
1970-tallet nå ville være fritt tilgjengelig for de neste Walt Disney å
bygge på uten tillatelse.  Men i dag er allemannseie presumtivt kun for
innhold fra før mellomkrigstiden.
</p><p>
Walt Disney hadde selvfølgelig ikke monopol på "Walt Disney-kreativitet".
Det har heller ikke USA.  Normen med fri kultur har, inntil nylig, og
unntatt i totalitære nasjoner, vært bredt utnyttet og svært universell.
</p><p>
Vurder for eksempel en form for kreativitet som synes underlig for mange
amerikanere, men som er overalt i japansk kultur:
<em class="citetitle">manga</em>, eller tegneserier.  Japanerne er fanatiske når
det gjelder tegneserier.  Over 40 prosent av publikasjoner er tegneserier,
og 30 prosent av publikasjonsomsetningen stammer fra tegneserier.  De er
over alt i det japanske samfunnet, tilgjengelig fra ethvert
tidsskriftsutsalg, og i hendene på en stor andel av pendlere på Japans
ekstraordinære system for offentlig transport.

Amerikanere har en tendens til å se ned på denne formen for kultur. Det er
et lite attraktivt kjennetegn hos oss.  Vi misforstår sannsynligvis mye
rundt manga, på grunn av at få av oss noen gang har lest noe som ligner på
historiene i disse "grafiske historiene" forteller.  For en japaner dekker
manga ethvert aspekt ved det sosiale liv.  For oss er tegneserier "menn i
strømpebukser".  Og uansett er det ikke slik at T-banen i New York er full
av folk som leser Joyse eller Hemingway for den saks skyld.  Folk i ulike
kulturer skiller seg ut på forskjellig måter, og japanerne på dette
interessante viset.
</p><p>
Men mitt formål her er ikke å forstå manga.  Det er å beskrive en variant av
manga som fra en advokats perspektiv er ganske merkelig, men som fra en
Disneys perspektiv er ganske godt kjent.
</p><p>

Dette er fenomenet <em class="citetitle">doujinshi</em>.  Doujinshi er også
tegneserier, men de er slags etterapings-tegneserier.  En rik etikk styrer
de som skaper doujinshi.  Det er ikke doujinshi hvis det
<span class="emphasis"><em>bare</em></span> er en kopi.  Kunstneren må gjøre et bidrag til
kunsten han kopierer ved å omforme det enten subtilt eller betydelig.  En
doujinshi-tegneserie kan dermed ta en massemarkeds-tegneserie og utvikle den
i en annen retning&#8212;med en annen historie-linje.  Eller tegneserien kan
beholde figuren som seg selv men endre litt på utseendet.  Det er ingen
bestemt formel for hva som gjør en doujinshi tilstrekkelig "forskjellig".
Men de må være forskjellige hvis de skal anses som ekte doujinshi.  Det er
faktisk komiteer som går igjennom doujinshi for å bli med på messer, og
avviser etterapninger som bare er en kopi.
</p><p>
Disse etterapings-tegneseriene er ikke en liten del av manga-markedet.  Det
er enorme.  Mer en 33 000 "sirkler" av skapere over hele Japan som
produserer disse bitene av Walt Disney-kreativitet.  Mer en 450 000 japanere
samles to ganger i året, i den største offentlige samlingen i langet, for å
bytte og selge dem.  Dette markedet er parallelt med det kommersielle
massemarkeds-manga-markedet.  På noen måter konkurrerer det åpenbart med det
markedet, men det er ingen vedvarende innsats fra de som kontrollerer det
kommersielle manga-markedet for å stenge doujinshi-markedet.  Det blomstrer,
på tross av konkurransen og til tross for loven.
</p><p>
Den mest gåtefulle egenskapen med doujinshi-markedet, for de som har
juridisk trening i hvert fall, er at det overhodet tillates å eksistere.
Under japansk opphavsrettslov, som i hvert fall på dette området (på
papiret) speiler USAs opphavsrettslov, er doujinshi-markedet ulovlig.
Doujinshi er helt klart "avledede verk".  Det er ingen generell praksis hos
doujinshi-kunstnere for å sikre seg tillatelse hos manga-skaperne.  I stedet
er praksisen ganske enkelt å ta og endre det andre har laget, slik Walt
Disney gjorde med <em class="citetitle">Steamboat Bill, Jr</em>.  For både
japansk og USAs lov, er å "ta" uten tillatelse fra den opprinnelige
opphavsrettsinnehaver ulovlig.  Det er et brudd på opphavsretten til det
opprinnelige verket å lage en kopi eller et avledet verk uten tillatelse fra
den opprinnelige rettighetsinnehaveren.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxwinickjudd"></a><p>
Likevel eksisterer dette illegale markedet og faktisk blomstrer i Japan, og
etter manges syn er det nettopp fordi det eksisterer at japansk manga
blomstrer.  Som USAs tegneserieskaper Judd Winick fortalte meg, "I
amerikansk tegneseriers første dager var det ganske likt det som foregår i
Japan i dag. . . . Amerikanske tegneserier kom til verden ved å kopiere
hverandre. . . . Det er slik [kunstnerne] lærer å tegne&#8212;ved å se i
tegneseriebøker og ikke følge streken, men ved å se på dem og kopiere dem"
og bygge basert på dem.<sup>[<a name="id2685344" href="#ftn.id2685344" class="footnote">23</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Amerikanske tegneserier nå er ganske annerledes, forklarer Winick, delvis på
grunn av de juridiske problemene med å tilpasse tegneserier slik doujinshi
får lov til.  Med for eksempel Supermann, fortalte Winick meg, "er det en
rekke regler, og du må følge dem".  Det er ting som Supermann "ikke kan"
gjøre.  "For en som lager tegneserier er det frustrerende å måtte begrense
seg til noen parameter som er femti år gamle."
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2685468"></a><p>
Normen i Japan reduserer denne juridiske utfordringen.  Noen sier at det
nettopp er den oppsamlede fordelen i det japanske mangamarkedet som
forklarer denne reduksjonen.  Jussprofessor Salil Mehra ved Temple
University hypotiserer for eksempel med at manga-markedet aksepterer disse
teoretiske bruddene fordi de får mangamarkedet til å bli rikere og mer
produktivt.  Alle ville få det verre hvis doujinshi ble bannlyst, så loven
bannlyser ikke doujinshi.<sup>[<a name="id2685494" href="#ftn.id2685494" class="footnote">24</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Problemet med denne historien, derimot, og som Mehra helt klart erkjenner,
er at mekanismen som produserer denne "hold hendene borte"-responsen ikke er
forstått.  Det kan godt være at markedet som helhet gjør det bedre hvis
doujinshi tillates i stedet for å bannlyse den, men det forklarer likevel
ikke hvorfor individuelle opphavsrettsinnehavere ikke saksøker.  Hvis loven
ikke har et generelt unntak for doujinshi, og det finnes faktisk noen
tilfeller der individuelle manga-kunstnere har saksøkt doujinshi-kunstnere,
hvorfor er det ikke et mer generelt mønster for å blokkere denne "frie
takingen" hos doujinshi-kulturen?
</p><p>
Jeg var fire nydelige måneder i Japan, og jeg stilte dette spørsmål så ofte
som jeg kunne.  Kanskje det beste svaret til slutt kom fra en venn i et
større japansk advokatfirma. "Vi har ikke nok advokater", fortalte han meg
en ettermiddag.  Det er "bare ikke nok ressurser til å tiltale tilfeller som
dette".
</p><p>

Dette er et tema vi kommer tilbake til: at lovens regulering både er en
funksjon av ordene i bøkene, og kostnadene med å få disse ordene til å ha
effekt.  Akkurat nå er det endel åpenbare spørsmål som presser seg frem:
Ville Japan gjøre det bedre med flere advokater? Ville manga være rikere
hvis doujinshi-kunstnere ble regelmessig rettsforfulgt?  Ville Japan vinne
noe viktig hvis de kunne stoppe praksisen med deling uten kompensasjon?
Skader piratvirksomhet ofrene for piratvirksomheten, eller hjelper den dem?
Ville advokaters kamp mot denne piratvirksomheten hjelpe deres klienter,
eller skade dem? La oss ta et øyeblikks pause.
</p><p>
Hvis du er som meg et tiår tilbake, eller som folk flest når de først
begynner å tenke på disse temaene, da bør du omtrent nå være rådvill om noe
du ikke hadde tenkt igjennom før.
</p><p>
Vi lever i en verden som feirer "eiendom".  Jeg er en av de som feierer.
Jeg tror på verdien av eiendom generelt, og jeg tror også på verdien av den
sære formen for eiendom som advokater kaller "immateriell
eiendom".<sup>[<a name="id2685588" href="#ftn.id2685588" class="footnote">25</a>]</sup> Et stort og variert samfunn
kan ikke overleve uten eiendom, og et moderne samfunn kan ikke blomstre uten
immaterielle eierrettigheter.
</p><p>
Men det tar bare noen sekunders refleksjon for å innse at det er masse av
verdi der ute som "eiendom" ikke dekker.  Jeg mener ikke "kjærlighet kan
ikke kjøpes med penger" men heller, at en verdi som ganske enkelt er del av
produksjonsprosessen, både for kommersiell og ikke-kommersiell produksjon.
Hvis Disneys animatører hadde stjålet et sett med blyanter for å tegne
Steamboat Willie, vi ville ikke nølt med å dømme det som galt&#8212;selv om
det er trivielt og selv om det ikke blir oppdaget.  Men det var intet galt,
i hvert fall slik loven var da, med at Disney tok fra Buster Keaton eller
fra Grimm-brødrene.  Det var intet galt med å ta fra Keaton, fordi Disneys
bruk ville blitt ansett som "rimelig".  Det var intet galt med å ta fra
brødrene Grimm fordi deres verker var allemannseie.
</p><p>

Dermed, selv om de tingene som Disney tok&#8212;eller mer generelt, tingene
som blir tatt av enhver som utøver Walt Disney-kreativitet&#8212;er
verdifulle, så anser ikke vår tradisjon det som galt å ta disse tingene.
Noen ting forblir frie til å bli tatt i en fri kultur og denne friheten er
bra.
</p><p>
Det er det samme med doujinshi-kulturen.  Hvis en doujinshi-kunstner brøt
seg inn på kontoret til en forlegger, og stakk av med tusen kopier av hans
siste verk&#8212;eller bare en kopi&#8212;uten å betale, så ville vi uten å
nøle si at kunstneren har gjort noe galt.  I tillegg til å ha trengt seg inn
på andres eiendom, ville han ha stjålet noe av verdi. Loven forbyr stjeling
i enhver form, uansett hvor stort eller lite som blir tatt.
</p><p>
Likevel er det en åpenbar motvilje, selv blant japanske advokater, for å si
at etterapende tegneseriekunstnere "stjeler".  Denne formen for Walt
Disney-kreativitet anses som rimelig og riktig, selv om spesielt advokater
synes det er vanskelig å forklare hvorfor.
</p><p>
Det er det same med tusen eksempler som dukker opp over alt med en gang en
begynner å se etter dem.  Forskene bygger på arbeidet til andre forskere
uten å spørre eller betale for privilegiet. ("Unnskyld meg, professor
Einstein, men kan jeg få tillatelse til å bruke din relativitetsteori til å
vise at du tok feil om kvantefysikk?") Teatertropper viser frem
bearbeidelser av verkene til Shapespere uten å sikre seg noen tillatelser.
(Er det <span class="emphasis"><em>noen</em></span> som tror at Shakespeare ville vært mer
spredt i vår kultur om det var et sentralt rettighetsklareringskontor for
Shakespeare som alle som laget Shakespear-produksjoner måtte appelere til
først?)  Og Hollywood går igjennom sykluser med en bestemt type filmer: fem
astroidefilmer i slutten av 1990-tallet, to vulkamkatastrofefilmer i 1997.
</p><p>

Skapere her og overalt har alltid og til alle tider bygd på kreativiteten
som eksisterte før og som omringer dem nå.  Denne byggingen er alltid og
overalt i det minste delvis gjort uten tillatelse og uten å kompensere den
opprinnelige skaperen.  Intet samfunn, fritt eller kontrollert, har noen
gang krevd at enhver bruk skulle bli betalt for eller at tillatelse for Walt
Disney-kreativitet alltid måtte skaffes.  Istedet har ethvert samfunn latt
en bestemt bit av sin kultur være fritt tilgjenglig for alle å ta&#8212;frie
samfunn muligens i større grad enn ufrie, men en viss grad i alle samfunn.

</p><p>
Det vanskelige spørsmålet er derfor ikke <span class="emphasis"><em>om</em></span> en kultur
er fri.  Alle kulturer er frie til en viss grad. Det vanskelige spørsmålet
er i stedet "<span class="emphasis"><em>hvor</em></span> fri er denne kulturen er?" Hvor mye
og hvor bredt, er kulturen fritt tilgjengelig for andre å ta, og bygge på?
Er den friheten begrenset til partimedlemmer?  Til medlemmer av
kongefamilien?  Til de ti største selskapene på New York-børsen?  Eller er
at frihet bredt tilgjengelig? Til kunstnere generelt, uansett om de er
tilknyttet til nasjonalmuseet eller ikke?  Til musikere generelt, uansett om
de er hvite eller ikke? Til filmskapere generelt, uansett om de er
tilknyttet et studio eller ikke?
</p><p>
Frie kulturer er kulturer som etterlater mye åpent for andre å bygge på.
Ufrie, eller tillatelse-kulturer etterlater mye mindre.  Vår var en fri
kultur. Den er på tur til å bli mindre fri.

Inntil 1976 ga opphavsrettsloven en forfatter to mulige verneperioder: en
initiell periode, og en fornyingsperiode.  Jeg har beregnet
"gjennomsnittlig" vernetid ved å finne vektet gjennomsnitt av de totale
registreringer for et gitt år, og andelen fornyinger.  Hvis 100
opphavsretter ble registrert i år 1, bare 15 av dem ble fornyet, og
fornyingsvernetiden er 28 år, så er gjennomsnittelig vernetid 32,2
år. Fornyingsdata og andre relevante data ligger på nettsidene tilknyttet

I 1839 fant Louis Daguerre opp den første praktiske teknologien for å
produsere det vi ville kalle "fotografier".  Rimelig nok ble de kalt
"daguerreotyper".  Prosessen var komplisert og kostbar, og feltet var dermed
begrenset til profesjonelle og noen få ivrige og velstående amatører.  (Det
var til og med en amerikansk Daguerre-forening som hjalp til med å regulere
industrien, slik alle slike foreninger gjør, ved å holde konkurransen ned
slikat prisene var høye.)  <a class="indexterm" name="id2685834"></a>
</p><p>
Men til tross for høye priser var etterspørselen etter daguerreotyper
sterk.  Dette inspirerte oppfinnere til å finne enklere og billigere måter å
lage "automatiske bilder".  William Talbot oppdaget snart en prosess for å
lage "negativer".  Men da negativene var av glass, og måtte holdes fuktige,
forble prosessen kostbar og tung.  På 1870-tallet ble tørrplater utviklet,
noe som gjorde det enklere å skille det å ta et bilde fra å fremkalle det.
Det var fortsatt plater av glass, og dermed var det fortsatt ikke en prosess
som var innenfor rekkevidden til de fleste amatører. <a class="indexterm" name="id2685854"></a>
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxeastmangeorge"></a><p>

Den teknologiske endringen som gjorde masse-fotografering mulig skjedde ikke
før i 1888, og det var takket være en eneste mann. George Eastman, selv en
amatørfotograf, var frustrert over den plate-baserte fotografi-teknologien.
I et lysglimt av innsikt (for å si det slik), forsto Eastman at hvis filmen
kunne gjøres bøybar, så kunne den holdes pæ en enkel rull.  Denne rullen
kunne så sendes til en fremkaller, og senke kostnadene til fotografering
vesentlig.  Ved å reduseere kostnadene, forventet Eastman at han dramatisk
kunne utvide andelen fotografer.
</p><p>
Eastman utviklet bøybart, emulsjons-belagt papirfil og plasserte ruller med
dette i små, enkle kameraer: Kodaken.  Enheten ble markedsfør med grunnlag
dens enkelhet. "Du trykker på knappen og vi fikser resten."<sup>[<a name="id2685902" href="#ftn.id2685902" class="footnote">26</a>]</sup> Som han beskrev det i <em class="citetitle">The Kodak
Primer</em>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The principle of the Kodak system is the separation of the work that any
person whomsoever can do in making a photograph, from the work that only an
expert can do. . . . We furnish anybody, man, woman or child, who has
sufficient intelligence to point a box straight and press a button, with an
instrument which altogether removes from the practice of photography the
necessity for exceptional facilities or, in fact, any special knowledge of
the art. It can be employed without preliminary study, without a darkroom
and without chemicals.<sup>[<a name="id2685930" href="#ftn.id2685930" class="footnote">27</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
For $25, anyone could make pictures. The camera came preloaded with film,
and when it had been used, the camera was returned to an Eastman factory,
where the film was developed. Over time, of course, the cost of the camera
and the ease with which it could be used both improved. Roll film thus
became the basis for the explosive growth of popular photography. Eastman's
camera first went on sale in 1888; one year later, Kodak was printing more
than six thousand negatives a day.  From 1888 through 1909, while industrial
production was rising by 4.7 percent, photographic equipment and material
sales increased by 11 percent.<sup>[<a name="id2685973" href="#ftn.id2685973" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup> Eastman
Kodak's sales during the same period experienced an average annual increase
of over 17 percent.<sup>[<a name="id2685981" href="#ftn.id2685981" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup>
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2685990"></a><p>


The real significance of Eastman's invention, however, was not economic. It
was social. Professional photography gave individuals a glimpse of places
they would never otherwise see. Amateur photography gave them the ability to
record their own lives in a way they had never been able to do before. As
author Brian Coe notes, "For the first time the snapshot album provided the
man on the street with a permanent record of his family and its
activities. . . . For the first time in history there exists an authentic
visual record of the appearance and activities of the common man made
without [literary] interpretation or bias."<sup>[<a name="id2686010" href="#ftn.id2686010" class="footnote">30</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
In this way, the Kodak camera and film were technologies of expression.  The
pencil or paintbrush was also a technology of expression, of course. But it
took years of training before they could be deployed by amateurs in any
useful or effective way. With the Kodak, expression was possible much sooner
and more simply. The barrier to expression was lowered. Snobs would sneer at
its "quality"; professionals would discount it as irrelevant. But watch a
child study how best to frame a picture and you get a sense of the
experience of creativity that the Kodak enabled. Democratic tools gave
ordinary people a way to express themselves more easily than any tools could
have before.
</p><p>
What was required for this technology to flourish? Obviously, Eastman's
genius was an important part. But also important was the legal environment
within which Eastman's invention grew. For early in the history of
photography, there was a series of judicial decisions that could well have
changed the course of photography substantially.  Courts were asked whether
the photographer, amateur or professional, required permission before he
could capture and print whatever image he wanted. Their answer was
no.<sup>[<a name="id2686045" href="#ftn.id2686045" class="footnote">31</a>]</sup>
</p><p>

The arguments in favor of requiring permission will sound surprisingly
familiar. The photographer was "taking" something from the person or
building whose photograph he shot&#8212;pirating something of value. Some
even thought he was taking the target's soul. Just as Disney was not free to
take the pencils that his animators used to draw Mickey, so, too, should
these photographers not be free to take images that they thought valuable.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2686077"></a><p>
On the other side was an argument that should be familiar, as well.  Sure,
there may be something of value being used. But citizens should have the
right to capture at least those images that stand in public view.  (Louis
Brandeis, who would become a Supreme Court Justice, thought the rule should
be different for images from private spaces.<sup>[<a name="id2686100" href="#ftn.id2686100" class="footnote">32</a>]</sup>) It may be that this means that the photographer gets something for
nothing. Just as Disney could take inspiration from <em class="citetitle">Steamboat
Bill, Jr</em>. or the Brothers Grimm, the photographer should be free
to capture an image without compensating the source.
</p><p>
Fortunately for Mr. Eastman, and for photography in general, these early
decisions went in favor of the pirates. In general, no permission would be
required before an image could be captured and shared with others. Instead,
permission was presumed. Freedom was the default.  (The law would eventually
craft an exception for famous people: commercial photographers who snap
pictures of famous people for commercial purposes have more restrictions
than the rest of us. But in the ordinary case, the image can be captured
without clearing the rights to do the capturing.<sup>[<a name="id2686144" href="#ftn.id2686144" class="footnote">33</a>]</sup>)
</p><p>
We can only speculate about how photography would have developed had the law
gone the other way. If the presumption had been against the photographer,
then the photographer would have had to demonstrate permission. Perhaps
Eastman Kodak would have had to demonstrate permission, too, before it
developed the film upon which images were captured. After all, if permission
were not granted, then Eastman Kodak would be benefiting from the "theft"
committed by the photographer. Just as Napster benefited from the copyright
infringements committed by Napster users, Kodak would be benefiting from the
"image-right" infringement of its photographers. We could imagine the law
then requiring that some form of permission be demonstrated before a company
developed pictures. We could imagine a system developing to demonstrate that
permission.
</p><p>



But though we could imagine this system of permission, it would be very hard
to see how photography could have flourished as it did if the requirement
for permission had been built into the rules that govern it. Photography
would have existed. It would have grown in importance over
time. Professionals would have continued to use the technology as they
did&#8212;since professionals could have more easily borne the burdens of
the permission system. But the spread of photography to ordinary people
would not have occurred. Nothing like that growth would have been
realized. And certainly, nothing like that growth in a democratic technology
of expression would have been realized.  If you drive through San
Francisco's Presidio, you might see two gaudy yellow school buses painted
over with colorful and striking images, and the logo "Just Think!" in place
of the name of a school. But there's little that's "just" cerebral in the
projects that these busses enable.  These buses are filled with technologies
that teach kids to tinker with film. Not the film of Eastman. Not even the
film of your VCR.  Rather the "film" of digital cameras. Just Think! is a
project that enables kids to make films, as a way to understand and critique
the filmed culture that they find all around them. Each year, these busses
travel to more than thirty schools and enable three hundred to five hundred
children to learn something about media by doing something with media.  By
doing, they think. By tinkering, they learn.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2686191"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2686227"></a><p>
These buses are not cheap, but the technology they carry is increasingly
so. The cost of a high-quality digital video system has fallen
dramatically.  As one analyst puts it, "Five years ago, a good real-time
digital video editing system cost $25,000. Today you can get professional
quality for $595."<sup>[<a name="id2686243" href="#ftn.id2686243" class="footnote">34</a>]</sup> These buses are
filled with technology that would have cost hundreds of thousands just ten
years ago. And it is now feasible to imagine not just buses like this, but
classrooms across the country where kids are learning more and more of
something teachers call "media literacy."
</p><p>

"Media literacy," as Dave Yanofsky, the executive director of Just Think!,
puts it, "is the ability . . . to understand, analyze, and deconstruct media
images. Its aim is to make [kids] literate about the way media works, the
way it's constructed, the way it's delivered, and the way people access it."
<a class="indexterm" name="id2686271"></a>
</p><p>
This may seem like an odd way to think about "literacy." For most people,
literacy is about reading and writing. Faulkner and Hemingway and noticing
split infinitives are the things that "literate" people know about.
</p><p>
Maybe. But in a world where children see on average 390 hours of television
commercials per year, or between 20,000 and 45,000 commercials
generally,<sup>[<a name="id2686292" href="#ftn.id2686292" class="footnote">35</a>]</sup> it is increasingly important
to understand the "grammar" of media. For just as there is a grammar for the
written word, so, too, is there one for media. And just as kids learn how to
write by writing lots of terrible prose, kids learn how to write media by
constructing lots of (at least at first) terrible media.
</p><p>
A growing field of academics and activists sees this form of literacy as
crucial to the next generation of culture. For though anyone who has written
understands how difficult writing is&#8212;how difficult it is to sequence
the story, to keep a reader's attention, to craft language to be
understandable&#8212;few of us have any real sense of how difficult media
is. Or more fundamentally, few of us have a sense of how media works, how it
holds an audience or leads it through a story, how it triggers emotion or
builds suspense.
</p><p>
It took filmmaking a generation before it could do these things well.  But
even then, the knowledge was in the filming, not in writing about the
film. The skill came from experiencing the making of a film, not from
reading a book about it. One learns to write by writing and then reflecting
upon what one has written. One learns to write with images by making them
and then reflecting upon what one has created.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2686336"></a><p>
This grammar has changed as media has changed. When it was just film, as
Elizabeth Daley, executive director of the University of Southern
California's Annenberg Center for Communication and dean of the USC School
of Cinema-Television, explained to me, the grammar was about "the placement
of objects, color, . . . rhythm, pacing, and texture."<sup>[<a name="id2686351" href="#ftn.id2686351" class="footnote">36</a>]</sup> But as computers open up an interactive space where
a story is "played" as well as experienced, that grammar changes. The simple
control of narrative is lost, and so other techniques are necessary. Author
Michael Crichton had mastered the narrative of science fiction.  But when he
tried to design a computer game based on one of his works, it was a new
craft he had to learn. How to lead people through a game without their
feeling they have been led was not obvious, even to a wildly successful
author.<sup>[<a name="id2686391" href="#ftn.id2686391" class="footnote">37</a>]</sup>
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2686413"></a><p>
This skill is precisely the craft a filmmaker learns. As Daley describes,
"people are very surprised about how they are led through a film. [I]t is
perfectly constructed to keep you from seeing it, so you have no idea. If a
filmmaker succeeds you do not know how you were led." If you know you were
led through a film, the film has failed.
</p><p>
Yet the push for an expanded literacy&#8212;one that goes beyond text to
include audio and visual elements&#8212;is not about making better film
directors.  The aim is not to improve the profession of filmmaking at all.
Instead, as Daley explained,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
From my perspective, probably the most important digital divide is not
access to a box. It's the ability to be empowered with the language that
that box works in. Otherwise only a very few people can write with this
language, and all the rest of us are reduced to being read-only.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
"Skrivebeskyttet." Passive mottakerne av kultur produsert andre
steder. Sofapoteter. Forbrukere. Dette er medieverden fra det tjuende
århundre.
</p><p>
The twenty-first century could be different. This is the crucial point: It
could be both read and write. Or at least reading and better understanding
the craft of writing. Or best, reading and understanding the tools that
enable the writing to lead or mislead. The aim of any literacy, and this
literacy in particular, is to "empower people to choose the appropriate
language for what they need to create or express."<sup>[<a name="id2686465" href="#ftn.id2686465" class="footnote">38</a>]</sup> It is to enable students "to communicate in the
language of the twenty-first century."<sup>[<a name="id2686483" href="#ftn.id2686483" class="footnote">39</a>]</sup>
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2686491"></a><p>
As with any language, this language comes more easily to some than to
others. It doesn't necessarily come more easily to those who excel in
written language. Daley and Stephanie Barish, director of the Institute for
Multimedia Literacy at the Annenberg Center, describe one particularly
poignant example of a project they ran in a high school.  The high school
was a very poor inner-city Los Angeles school. In all the traditional
measures of success, this school was a failure. But Daley and Barish ran a
program that gave kids an opportunity to use film to express meaning about
something the students know something about&#8212;gun violence.
</p><p>
The class was held on Friday afternoons, and it created a relatively new
problem for the school. While the challenge in most classes was getting the
kids to come, the challenge in this class was keeping them away. The "kids
were showing up at 6 A.M. and leaving at 5 at night," said Barish. They were
working harder than in any other class to do what education should be
about&#8212;learning how to express themselves.
</p><p>
Using whatever "free web stuff they could find," and relatively simple tools
to enable the kids to mix "image, sound, and text," Barish said this class
produced a series of projects that showed something about gun violence that
few would otherwise understand. This was an issue close to the lives of
these students. The project "gave them a tool and empowered them to be able
to both understand it and talk about it," Barish explained. That tool
succeeded in creating expression&#8212;far more successfully and powerfully
than could have been created using only text. "If you had said to these
students, `you have to do it in text,' they would've just thrown their hands
up and gone and done something else," Barish described, in part, no doubt,
because expressing themselves in text is not something these students can do
well. Yet neither is text a form in which <span class="emphasis"><em>these</em></span> ideas
can be expressed well. The power of this message depended upon its
connection to this form of expression.
</p><p>



"But isn't education about teaching kids to write?" I asked. In part, of
course, it is. But why are we teaching kids to write? Education, Daley
explained, is about giving students a way of "constructing meaning." To say
that that means just writing is like saying teaching writing is only about
teaching kids how to spell. Text is one part&#8212;and increasingly, not the
most powerful part&#8212;of constructing meaning. As Daley explained in the
most moving part of our interview,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
What you want is to give these students ways of constructing meaning. If all
you give them is text, they're not going to do it.  Because they can't. You
know, you've got Johnny who can look at a video, he can play a video game,
he can do graffiti all over your walls, he can take your car apart, and he
can do all sorts of other things. He just can't read your text. So Johnny
comes to school and you say, "Johnny, you're illiterate. Nothing you can do
matters." Well, Johnny then has two choices: He can dismiss you or he [can]
dismiss himself. If his ego is healthy at all, he's going to dismiss
you. [But i]nstead, if you say, "Well, with all these things that you can
do, let's talk about this issue. Play for me music that you think reflects
that, or show me images that you think reflect that, or draw for me
something that reflects that." Not by giving a kid a video camera and
. . . saying, "Let's go have fun with the video camera and make a little
movie." But instead, really help you take these elements that you
understand, that are your language, and construct meaning about the
topic. . . .
</p><p>
That empowers enormously. And then what happens, of course, is eventually,
as it has happened in all these classes, they bump up against the fact, "I
need to explain this and I really need to write something." And as one of
the teachers told Stephanie, they would rewrite a paragraph 5, 6, 7, 8
times, till they got it right.
</p><p>

Because they needed to. There was a reason for doing it. They needed to say
something, as opposed to just jumping through your hoops. They actually
needed to use a language that they didn't speak very well. But they had come
to understand that they had a lot of power with this language."
</p></blockquote></div><p>
When two planes crashed into the World Trade Center, another into the
Pentagon, and a fourth into a Pennsylvania field, all media around the world
shifted to this news. Every moment of just about every day for that week,
and for weeks after, television in particular, and media generally, retold
the story of the events we had just witnessed. The telling was a retelling,
because we had seen the events that were described. The genius of this awful
act of terrorism was that the delayed second attack was perfectly timed to
assure that the whole world would be watching.
</p><p>
These retellings had an increasingly familiar feel. There was music scored
for the intermissions, and fancy graphics that flashed across the
screen. There was a formula to interviews. There was "balance," and
seriousness. This was news choreographed in the way we have increasingly
come to expect it, "news as entertainment," even if the entertainment is
tragedy.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2686625"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2686631"></a><p>
But in addition to this produced news about the "tragedy of September 11,"
those of us tied to the Internet came to see a very different production as
well. The Internet was filled with accounts of the same events. Yet these
Internet accounts had a very different flavor. Some people constructed photo
pages that captured images from around the world and presented them as slide
shows with text. Some offered open letters. There were sound
recordings. There was anger and frustration.  There were attempts to provide
context. There was, in short, an extraordinary worldwide barn raising, in
the sense Mike Godwin uses the term in his book <em class="citetitle">Cyber
Rights</em>, around a news event that had captured the attention of
the world. There was ABC and CBS, but there was also the Internet.
</p><p>

I don't mean simply to praise the Internet&#8212;though I do think the
people who supported this form of speech should be praised. I mean instead
to point to a significance in this form of speech. For like a Kodak, the
Internet enables people to capture images. And like in a movie by a student
on the "Just Think!" bus, the visual images could be mixed with sound or
text.
</p><p>
But unlike any technology for simply capturing images, the Internet allows
these creations to be shared with an extraordinary number of people,
practically instantaneously. This is something new in our
tradition&#8212;not just that culture can be captured mechanically, and
obviously not just that events are commented upon critically, but that this
mix of captured images, sound, and commentary can be widely spread
practically instantaneously.
</p><p>
September 11 was not an aberration. It was a beginning. Around the same
time, a form of communication that has grown dramatically was just beginning
to come into public consciousness: the Web-log, or blog. The blog is a kind
of public diary, and within some cultures, such as in Japan, it functions
very much like a diary. In those cultures, it records private facts in a
public way&#8212;it's a kind of electronic <em class="citetitle">Jerry
Springer</em>, available anywhere in the world.
</p><p>
But in the United States, blogs have taken on a very different character.
There are some who use the space simply to talk about their private
life. But there are many who use the space to engage in public
discourse. Discussing matters of public import, criticizing others who are
mistaken in their views, criticizing politicians about the decisions they
make, offering solutions to problems we all see: blogs create the sense of a
virtual public meeting, but one in which we don't all hope to be there at
the same time and in which conversations are not necessarily linked. The
best of the blog entries are relatively short; they point directly to words
used by others, criticizing with or adding to them.  They are arguably the
most important form of unchoreographed public discourse that we have.
</p><p>

That's a strong statement. Yet it says as much about our democracy as it
does about blogs. This is the part of America that is most difficult for
those of us who love America to accept: Our democracy has atrophied.  Of
course we have elections, and most of the time the courts allow those
elections to count. A relatively small number of people vote in those
elections. The cycle of these elections has become totally professionalized
and routinized. Most of us think this is democracy.
</p><p>
But democracy has never just been about elections. Democracy means rule by
the people, but rule means something more than mere elections. In our
tradition, it also means control through reasoned discourse.  This was the
idea that captured the imagination of Alexis de Tocqueville, the
nineteenth-century French lawyer who wrote the most important account of
early "Democracy in America." It wasn't popular elections that fascinated
him&#8212;it was the jury, an institution that gave ordinary people the
right to choose life or death for other citizens.  And most fascinating for
him was that the jury didn't just vote about the outcome they would
impose. They deliberated. Members argued about the "right" result; they
tried to persuade each other of the "right" result, and in criminal cases at
least, they had to agree upon a unanimous result for the process to come to
an end.<sup>[<a name="id2686672" href="#ftn.id2686672" class="footnote">40</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Yet even this institution flags in American life today. And in its place,
there is no systematic effort to enable citizen deliberation. Some are
pushing to create just such an institution.<sup>[<a name="id2686759" href="#ftn.id2686759" class="footnote">41</a>]</sup> And in some towns in New England, something close to deliberation
remains. But for most of us for most of the time, there is no time or place
for "democratic deliberation" to occur.
</p><p>
More bizarrely, there is generally not even permission for it to occur.  We,
the most powerful democracy in the world, have developed a strong norm
against talking about politics. It's fine to talk about politics with people
you agree with. But it is rude to argue about politics with people you
disagree with. Political discourse becomes isolated, and isolated discourse
becomes more extreme.<sup>[<a name="id2686784" href="#ftn.id2686784" class="footnote">42</a>]</sup> We say what our
friends want to hear, and hear very little beyond what our friends say.
</p><p>

Enter the blog. The blog's very architecture solves one part of this
problem. People post when they want to post, and people read when they want
to read. The most difficult time is synchronous time.  Technologies that
enable asynchronous communication, such as e-mail, increase the opportunity
for communication. Blogs allow for public discourse without the public ever
needing to gather in a single public place.
</p><p>
But beyond architecture, blogs also have solved the problem of
norms. There's no norm (yet) in blog space not to talk about politics.
Indeed, the space is filled with political speech, on both the right and the
left. Some of the most popular sites are conservative or libertarian, but
there are many of all political stripes. And even blogs that are not
political cover political issues when the occasion merits.
</p><p>
The significance of these blogs is tiny now, though not so tiny. The name
Howard Dean may well have faded from the 2004 presidential race but for
blogs. Yet even if the number of readers is small, the reading is having an
effect.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2686827"></a>
</p><p>
One direct effect is on stories that had a different life cycle in the
mainstream media. The Trent Lott affair is an example. When Lott "misspoke"
at a party for Senator Strom Thurmond, essentially praising Thurmond's
segregationist policies, he calculated correctly that this story would
disappear from the mainstream press within forty-eight hours. It did. But he
didn't calculate its life cycle in blog space. The bloggers kept researching
the story. Over time, more and more instances of the same "misspeaking"
emerged. Finally, the story broke back into the mainstream press. In the
end, Lott was forced to resign as senate majority leader.<sup>[<a name="id2686846" href="#ftn.id2686846" class="footnote">43</a>]</sup> <a class="indexterm" name="id2686855"></a>
</p><p>
This different cycle is possible because the same commercial pressures don't
exist with blogs as with other ventures. Television and newspapers are
commercial entities. They must work to keep attention.  If they lose
readers, they lose revenue. Like sharks, they must move on.
</p><p>
But bloggers don't have a similar constraint. They can obsess, they can
focus, they can get serious. If a particular blogger writes a particularly
interesting story, more and more people link to that story. And as the
number of links to a particular story increases, it rises in the ranks of
stories. People read what is popular; what is popular has been selected by a
very democratic process of peer-generated rankings.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxwinerdave"></a><p>

There's a second way, as well, in which blogs have a different cycle from
the mainstream press. As Dave Winer, one of the fathers of this movement and
a software author for many decades, told me, another difference is the
absence of a financial "conflict of interest." "I think you have to take the
conflict of interest" out of journalism, Winer told me.  "An amateur
journalist simply doesn't have a conflict of interest, or the conflict of
interest is so easily disclosed that you know you can sort of get it out of
the way."
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2686907"></a><p>
These conflicts become more important as media becomes more concentrated
(more on this below). A concentrated media can hide more from the public
than an unconcentrated media can&#8212;as CNN admitted it did after the Iraq
war because it was afraid of the consequences to its own
employees.<sup>[<a name="id2686733" href="#ftn.id2686733" class="footnote">44</a>]</sup> It also needs to sustain a
more coherent account. (In the middle of the Iraq war, I read a post on the
Internet from someone who was at that time listening to a satellite uplink
with a reporter in Iraq. The New York headquarters was telling the reporter
over and over that her account of the war was too bleak: She needed to offer
a more optimistic story. When she told New York that wasn't warranted, they
told her <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> they were writing "the story.")
</p><p> Blog space gives amateurs a way to enter the debate&#8212;"amateur" not in
the sense of inexperienced, but in the sense of an Olympic athlete, meaning
not paid by anyone to give their reports. It allows for a much broader range
of input into a story, as reporting on the Columbia disaster revealed, when
hundreds from across the southwest United States turned to the Internet to
retell what they had seen.<sup>[<a name="id2686942" href="#ftn.id2686942" class="footnote">45</a>]</sup> And it
drives readers to read across the range of accounts and "triangulate," as
Winer puts it, the truth. Blogs, Winer says, are "communicating directly
with our constituency, and the middle man is out of it"&#8212;with all the
benefits, and costs, that might entail.
</p><p>

Winer is optimistic about the future of journalism infected with
blogs. "It's going to become an essential skill," Winer predicts, for public
figures and increasingly for private figures as well. It's not clear that
"journalism" is happy about this&#8212;some journalists have been told to
curtail their blogging.<sup>[<a name="id2686972" href="#ftn.id2686972" class="footnote">46</a>]</sup> But it is clear
that we are still in transition. "A lot of what we are doing now is warm-up
exercises," Winer told me.  There is a lot that must mature before this
space has its mature effect.  And as the inclusion of content in this space
is the least infringing use of the Internet (meaning infringing on
copyright), Winer said, "we will be the last thing that gets shut down."
</p><p>
This speech affects democracy. Winer thinks that happens because "you don't
have to work for somebody who controls, [for] a gatekeeper." That is
true. But it affects democracy in another way as well.  As more and more
citizens express what they think, and defend it in writing, that will change
the way people understand public issues. It is easy to be wrong and
misguided in your head. It is harder when the product of your mind can be
criticized by others. Of course, it is a rare human who admits that he has
been persuaded that he is wrong. But it is even rarer for a human to ignore
when he has been proven wrong.  The writing of ideas, arguments, and
criticism improves democracy.  Today there are probably a couple of million
blogs where such writing happens. When there are ten million, there will be
something extraordinary to report.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2687038"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idxbrownjohnseely"></a><p>
John Seely Brown is the chief scientist of the Xerox Corporation.  His work,
as his Web site describes it, is "human learning and . . . the creation of
knowledge ecologies for creating . . . innovation."
</p><p>
Brown thus looks at these technologies of digital creativity a bit
differently from the perspectives I've sketched so far. I'm sure he would be
excited about any technology that might improve democracy. But his real
excitement comes from how these technologies affect learning.
</p><p>

As Brown believes, we learn by tinkering. When "a lot of us grew up," he
explains, that tinkering was done "on motorcycle engines, lawnmower engines,
automobiles, radios, and so on." But digital technologies enable a different
kind of tinkering&#8212;with abstract ideas though in concrete form. The
kids at Just Think! not only think about how a commercial portrays a
politician; using digital technology, they can take the commercial apart and
manipulate it, tinker with it to see how it does what it does. Digital
technologies launch a kind of bricolage, or "free collage," as Brown calls
it. Many get to add to or transform the tinkering of many others.
</p><p>
The best large-scale example of this kind of tinkering so far is free
software or open-source software (FS/OSS). FS/OSS is software whose source
code is shared. Anyone can download the technology that makes a FS/OSS
program run. And anyone eager to learn how a particular bit of FS/OSS
technology works can tinker with the code.
</p><p>
This opportunity creates a "completely new kind of learning platform," as
Brown describes. "As soon as you start doing that, you . . .  unleash a free
collage on the community, so that other people can start looking at your
code, tinkering with it, trying it out, seeing if they can improve it." Each
effort is a kind of apprenticeship. "Open source becomes a major
apprenticeship platform."
</p><p>
In this process, "the concrete things you tinker with are abstract.  They
are code." Kids are "shifting to the ability to tinker in the abstract, and
this tinkering is no longer an isolated activity that you're doing in your
garage. You are tinkering with a community platform. . . .  You are
tinkering with other people's stuff. The more you tinker the more you
improve." The more you improve, the more you learn.
</p><p>
This same thing happens with content, too. And it happens in the same
collaborative way when that content is part of the Web. As Brown puts it,
"the Web [is] the first medium that truly honors multiple forms of
intelligence." Earlier technologies, such as the typewriter or word
processors, helped amplify text. But the Web amplifies much more than
text. "The Web . . . says if you are musical, if you are artistic, if you
are visual, if you are interested in film . . . [then] there is a lot you
can start to do on this medium. [It] can now amplify and honor these
multiple forms of intelligence."
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2687139"></a><p>

Brown is talking about what Elizabeth Daley, Stephanie Barish, and Just
Think! teach: that this tinkering with culture teaches as well as
creates. It develops talents differently, and it builds a different kind of
recognition.
</p><p>
Yet the freedom to tinker with these objects is not guaranteed.  Indeed, as
we'll see through the course of this book, that freedom is increasingly
highly contested. While there's no doubt that your father had the right to
tinker with the car engine, there's great doubt that your child will have
the right to tinker with the images she finds all around.  The law and,
increasingly, technology interfere with a freedom that technology, and
curiosity, would otherwise ensure.
</p><p>
These restrictions have become the focus of researchers and scholars.
Professor Ed Felten of Princeton (whom we'll see more of in chapter <a class="xref" href="#property-i" title='Kapittel 11. Kapittel ti: "Eiendom"'>11</a>)  has developed a
powerful argument in favor of the "right to tinker" as it applies to
computer science and to knowledge in general.<sup>[<a name="id2687179" href="#ftn.id2687179" class="footnote">47</a>]</sup> But Brown's concern is earlier, or younger, or more fundamental. It
is about the learning that kids can do, or can't do, because of the law.
</p><p>
"This is where education in the twenty-first century is going," Brown
explains. We need to "understand how kids who grow up digital think and want
to learn."
</p><p>
"Yet," as Brown continued, and as the balance of this book will evince, "we
are building a legal system that completely suppresses the natural
tendencies of today's digital kids. . . . We're building an architecture
that unleashes 60 percent of the brain [and] a legal system that closes down
that part of the brain."

Høsten 2001, ble Jesse Jordan fra Oceanside, New York, innrullert som
førsteårsstudent ved Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, i Troy, New York.
Hans studieprogram ved RPI var informasjonsteknologi.  Selv om han ikke var
en programmerer, bestemte Jesse seg i oktober å begynne å fikle med en
søkemotorteknologi som var tilgjengelig på RPI-nettverket.
</p><p>
RPI is one of America's foremost technological research institutions.  It
offers degrees in fields ranging from architecture and engineering to
information sciences. More than 65 percent of its five thousand
undergraduates finished in the top 10 percent of their high school
class. The school is thus a perfect mix of talent and experience to imagine
and then build, a generation for the network age.
</p><p>
RPI's computer network links students, faculty, and administration to one
another. It also links RPI to the Internet. Not everything available on the
RPI network is available on the Internet. But the network is designed to
enable students to get access to the Internet, as well as more intimate
access to other members of the RPI community.
</p><p>

Search engines are a measure of a network's intimacy. Google brought the
Internet much closer to all of us by fantastically improving the quality of
search on the network. Specialty search engines can do this even better. The
idea of "intranet" search engines, search engines that search within the
network of a particular institution, is to provide users of that institution
with better access to material from that institution.  Businesses do this
all the time, enabling employees to have access to material that people
outside the business can't get. Universities do it as well.
</p><p>
These engines are enabled by the network technology itself.  Microsoft, for
example, has a network file system that makes it very easy for search
engines tuned to that network to query the system for information about the
publicly (within that network) available content.  Jesse's search engine was
built to take advantage of this technology. It used Microsoft's network file
system to build an index of all the files available within the RPI network.
</p><p>
Jesse's wasn't the first search engine built for the RPI network.  Indeed,
his engine was a simple modification of engines that others had built. His
single most important improvement over those engines was to fix a bug within
the Microsoft file-sharing system that could cause a user's computer to
crash. With the engines that existed before, if you tried to access a file
through a Windows browser that was on a computer that was off-line, your
computer could crash. Jesse modified the system a bit to fix that problem,
by adding a button that a user could click to see if the machine holding the
file was still on-line.
</p><p>
Jesse's engine went on-line in late October. Over the following six months,
he continued to tweak it to improve its functionality. By March, the system
was functioning quite well. Jesse had more than one million files in his
directory, including every type of content that might be on users'
computers.
</p><p>

Thus the index his search engine produced included pictures, which students
could use to put on their own Web sites; copies of notes or research; copies
of information pamphlets; movie clips that students might have created;
university brochures&#8212;basically anything that users of the RPI network
made available in a public folder of their computer.
</p><p>
But the index also included music files. In fact, one quarter of the files
that Jesse's search engine listed were music files. But that means, of
course, that three quarters were not, and&#8212;so that this point is
absolutely clear&#8212;Jesse did nothing to induce people to put music files
in their public folders. He did nothing to target the search engine to these
files. He was a kid tinkering with a Google-like technology at a university
where he was studying information science, and hence, tinkering was the
aim. Unlike Google, or Microsoft, for that matter, he made no money from
this tinkering; he was not connected to any business that would make any
money from this experiment. He was a kid tinkering with technology in an
environment where tinkering with technology was precisely what he was
supposed to do.
</p><p>
On April 3, 2003, Jesse was contacted by the dean of students at RPI. The
dean informed Jesse that the Recording Industry Association of America, the
RIAA, would be filing a lawsuit against him and three other students whom he
didn't even know, two of them at other universities.  A few hours later,
Jesse was served with papers from the suit.  As he read these papers and
watched the news reports about them, he was increasingly astonished.
</p><p>
"It was absurd," he told me. "I don't think I did anything wrong. . . .  I
don't think there's anything wrong with the search engine that I ran or
. . . what I had done to it. I mean, I hadn't modified it in any way that
promoted or enhanced the work of pirates. I just modified the search engine
in a way that would make it easier to use"&#8212;again, a <span class="emphasis"><em>search
engine</em></span>, which Jesse had not himself built, using the Windows
filesharing system, which Jesse had not himself built, to enable members of
the RPI community to get access to content, which Jesse had not himself
created or posted, and the vast majority of which had nothing to do with
music.
</p><p>

But the RIAA branded Jesse a pirate. They claimed he operated a network and
had therefore "willfully" violated copyright laws. They demanded that he pay
them the damages for his wrong. For cases of "willful infringement," the
Copyright Act specifies something lawyers call "statutory damages." These
damages permit a copyright owner to claim $150,000 per infringement. As the
RIAA alleged more than one hundred specific copyright infringements, they
therefore demanded that Jesse pay them at least $15,000,000.
</p><p>
Similar lawsuits were brought against three other students: one other
student at RPI, one at Michigan Technical University, and one at
Princeton. Their situations were similar to Jesse's. Though each case was
different in detail, the bottom line in each was exactly the same: huge
demands for "damages" that the RIAA claimed it was entitled to.  If you
added up the claims, these four lawsuits were asking courts in the United
States to award the plaintiffs close to $100
<span class="emphasis"><em>billion</em></span>&#8212;six times the <span class="emphasis"><em>total</em></span>
profit of the film industry in 2001.<sup>[<a name="id2687424" href="#ftn.id2687424" class="footnote">48</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Jesse called his parents. They were supportive but a bit frightened.  An
uncle was a lawyer. He began negotiations with the RIAA. They demanded to
know how much money Jesse had. Jesse had saved $12,000 from summer jobs and
other employment. They demanded $12,000 to dismiss the case.
</p><p>
The RIAA wanted Jesse to admit to doing something wrong. He refused. They
wanted him to agree to an injunction that would essentially make it
impossible for him to work in many fields of technology for the rest of his
life. He refused. They made him understand that this process of being sued
was not going to be pleasant. (As Jesse's father recounted to me, the chief
lawyer on the case, Matt Oppenheimer, told Jesse, "You don't want to pay
another visit to a dentist like me.") And throughout, the RIAA insisted it
would not settle the case until it took every penny Jesse had saved.
</p><p>

Jesse's family was outraged at these claims. They wanted to fight.  But
Jesse's uncle worked to educate the family about the nature of the American
legal system. Jesse could fight the RIAA. He might even win. But the cost of
fighting a lawsuit like this, Jesse was told, would be at least $250,000. If
he won, he would not recover that money. If he won, he would have a piece of
paper saying he had won, and a piece of paper saying he and his family were
bankrupt.
</p><p>
Så Jesse hadde et mafia-lignende valg: $250,000 og en sjanse til å vinne,
eller $12.000 og et forlik.
</p><p>
The recording industry insists this is a matter of law and morality.  Let's
put the law aside for a moment and think about the morality.  Where is the
morality in a lawsuit like this? What is the virtue in scapegoatism? The
RIAA is an extraordinarily powerful lobby. The president of the RIAA is
reported to make more than $1 million a year.  Artists, on the other hand,
are not well paid. The average recording artist makes $45,900.<sup>[<a name="id2630278" href="#ftn.id2630278" class="footnote">49</a>]</sup> There are plenty of ways for the RIAA to affect and
direct policy. So where is the morality in taking money from a student for
running a search engine?<sup>[<a name="id2630294" href="#ftn.id2630294" class="footnote">50</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
23. juni overførte Jesse alle sine oppsparte midler til advokaten som jobbet
for RIA.  Saken mot ham ble trukket.  Og med dette, ble unggutten som hadde
fiklet med en datamaskin og blitt saksøkt for 15 millioner dollar en
aktivist:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I was definitely not an activist [before]. I never really meant to be an
activist. . . . [But] I've been pushed into this. In no way did I ever
foresee anything like this, but I think it's just completely absurd what the
RIAA has done.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Jesse's parents betray a certain pride in their reluctant activist. As his
father told me, Jesse "considers himself very conservative, and so do
I. . . . He's not a tree hugger. . . . I think it's bizarre that they would
pick on him. But he wants to let people know that they're sending the wrong
message. And he wants to correct the record."

If "piracy" means using the creative property of others without their
permission&#8212;if "if value, then right" is true&#8212;then the history of
the content industry is a history of piracy. Every important sector of "big
media" today&#8212;film, records, radio, and cable TV&#8212;was born of a
kind of piracy so defined. The consistent story is how last generation's
pirates join this generation's country club&#8212;until now.
</p><div class="section" title="Film"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="film"></a>Film</h2></div></div></div><p>

The film industry of Hollywood was built by fleeing pirates.<sup>[<a name="id2630375" href="#ftn.id2630375" class="footnote">51</a>]</sup> Creators and directors migrated from the East Coast
to California in the early twentieth century in part to escape controls that
patents granted the inventor of filmmaking, Thomas Edison. These controls
were exercised through a monopoly "trust," the Motion Pictures Patents
Company, and were based on Thomas Edison's creative property&#8212;patents.
Edison formed the MPPC to exercise the rights this creative property gave
him, and the MPPC was serious about the control it demanded.
</p><p>
As one commentator tells one part of the story,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A January 1909 deadline was set for all companies to comply with the
license. By February, unlicensed outlaws, who referred to themselves as
independents protested the trust and carried on business without submitting
to the Edison monopoly. In the summer of 1909 the independent movement was
in full-swing, with producers and theater owners using illegal equipment and
imported film stock to create their own underground market.
</p><p>
With the country experiencing a tremendous expansion in the number of
nickelodeons, the Patents Company reacted to the independent movement by
forming a strong-arm subsidiary known as the General Film Company to block
the entry of non-licensed independents. With coercive tactics that have
become legendary, General Film confiscated unlicensed equipment,
discontinued product supply to theaters which showed unlicensed films, and
effectively monopolized distribution with the acquisition of all U.S. film
exchanges, except for the one owned by the independent William Fox who
defied the Trust even after his license was revoked.<sup>[<a name="id2630434" href="#ftn.id2630434" class="footnote">52</a>]</sup> <a class="indexterm" name="id2630461"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2630468"></a>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The Napsters of those days, the "independents," were companies like Fox. And
no less than today, these independents were vigorously resisted.  "Shooting
was disrupted by machinery stolen, and `accidents' resulting in loss of
negatives, equipment, buildings and sometimes life and limb frequently
occurred."<sup>[<a name="id2630484" href="#ftn.id2630484" class="footnote">53</a>]</sup> That led the independents to
flee the East Coast. California was remote enough from Edison's reach that
filmmakers there could pirate his inventions without fear of the law. And
the leaders of Hollywood filmmaking, Fox most prominently, did just that.
</p><p>

Of course, California grew quickly, and the effective enforcement of federal
law eventually spread west. But because patents grant the patent holder a
truly "limited" monopoly (just seventeen years at that time), by the time
enough federal marshals appeared, the patents had expired. A new industry
had been born, in part from the piracy of Edison's creative property.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Innspilt musikk"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="recordedmusic"></a>Innspilt musikk</h2></div></div></div><p>
Plateindustrien ble født av en annen type piratvirksomhet, dog for å forstå
hvordan krever at en setter seg inn i detaljer om hvordan loven regulerer
musikk.
</p><p>
At the time that Edison and Henri Fourneaux invented machines for
reproducing music (Edison the phonograph, Fourneaux the player piano), the
law gave composers the exclusive right to control copies of their music and
the exclusive right to control public performances of their music. In other
words, in 1900, if I wanted a copy of Phil Russel's 1899 hit "Happy Mose,"
the law said I would have to pay for the right to get a copy of the musical
score, and I would also have to pay for the right to perform it publicly.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2688034"></a><p>
But what if I wanted to record "Happy Mose," using Edison's phonograph or
Fourneaux's player piano? Here the law stumbled. It was clear enough that I
would have to buy any copy of the musical score that I performed in making
this recording. And it was clear enough that I would have to pay for any
public performance of the work I was recording.  But it wasn't totally clear
that I would have to pay for a "public performance" if I recorded the song
in my own house (even today, you don't owe the Beatles anything if you sing
their songs in the shower), or if I recorded the song from memory (copies in
your brain are not&#8212;yet&#8212; regulated by copyright law). So if I
simply sang the song into a recording device in the privacy of my own home,
it wasn't clear that I owed the composer anything. And more importantly, it
wasn't clear whether I owed the composer anything if I then made copies of
those recordings.  Because of this gap in the law, then, I could effectively
pirate someone else's song without paying its composer anything.
</p><p>

The composers (and publishers) were none too happy about this capacity to
pirate. As South Dakota senator Alfred Kittredge put it,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Imagine the injustice of the thing. A composer writes a song or an opera. A
publisher buys at great expense the rights to the same and copyrights
it. Along come the phonographic companies and companies who cut music rolls
and deliberately steal the work of the brain of the composer and publisher
without any regard for [their] rights.<sup>[<a name="id2688080" href="#ftn.id2688080" class="footnote">54</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The innovators who developed the technology to record other people's works
were "sponging upon the toil, the work, the talent, and genius of American
composers,"<sup>[<a name="id2688103" href="#ftn.id2688103" class="footnote">55</a>]</sup> and the "music publishing
industry" was thereby "at the complete mercy of this one
pirate."<sup>[<a name="id2688113" href="#ftn.id2688113" class="footnote">56</a>]</sup> As John Philip Sousa put it,
in as direct a way as possible, "When they make money out of my pieces, I
want a share of it."<sup>[<a name="id2688124" href="#ftn.id2688124" class="footnote">57</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
These arguments have familiar echoes in the wars of our day. So, too, do the
arguments on the other side. The innovators who developed the player piano
argued that "it is perfectly demonstrable that the introduction of automatic
music players has not deprived any composer of anything he had before their
introduction." Rather, the machines increased the sales of sheet
music.<sup>[<a name="id2688142" href="#ftn.id2688142" class="footnote">58</a>]</sup> In any case, the innovators
argued, the job of Congress was "to consider first the interest of [the
public], whom they represent, and whose servants they are." "All talk about
`theft,'" the general counsel of the American Graphophone Company wrote, "is
the merest claptrap, for there exists no property in ideas musical, literary
or artistic, except as defined by statute."<sup>[<a name="id2688148" href="#ftn.id2688148" class="footnote">59</a>]</sup>
</p><p>

The law soon resolved this battle in favor of the composer
<span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the recording artist. Congress amended the law to
make sure that composers would be paid for the "mechanical reproductions" of
their music. But rather than simply granting the composer complete control
over the right to make mechanical reproductions, Congress gave recording
artists a right to record the music, at a price set by Congress, once the
composer allowed it to be recorded once. This is the part of copyright law
that makes cover songs possible. Once a composer authorizes a recording of
his song, others are free to record the same song, so long as they pay the
original composer a fee set by the law.
</p><p>
American law ordinarily calls this a "compulsory license," but I will refer
to it as a "statutory license." A statutory license is a license whose key
terms are set by law. After Congress's amendment of the Copyright Act in
1909, record companies were free to distribute copies of recordings so long
as they paid the composer (or copyright holder)  the fee set by the statute.
</p><p>
This is an exception within the law of copyright. When John Grisham writes a
novel, a publisher is free to publish that novel only if Grisham gives the
publisher permission. Grisham, in turn, is free to charge whatever he wants
for that permission. The price to publish Grisham is thus set by Grisham,
and copyright law ordinarily says you have no permission to use Grisham's
work except with permission of Grisham.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2688218"></a>
</p><p>
But the law governing recordings gives recording artists less. And thus, in
effect, the law <span class="emphasis"><em>subsidizes</em></span> the recording industry
through a kind of piracy&#8212;by giving recording artists a weaker right
than it otherwise gives creative authors. The Beatles have less control over
their creative work than Grisham does. And the beneficiaries of this less
control are the recording industry and the public. The recording industry
gets something of value for less than it otherwise would pay; the public
gets access to a much wider range of musical creativity. Indeed, Congress
was quite explicit about its reasons for granting this right. Its fear was
the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that power would stifle
follow-on creativity.<sup>[<a name="id2630400" href="#ftn.id2630400" class="footnote">60</a>]</sup> <a class="indexterm" name="id2688259"></a>
</p><p>
While the recording industry has been quite coy about this recently,
historically it has been quite a supporter of the statutory license for
records. As a 1967 report from the House Committee on the Judiciary relates,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
the record producers argued vigorously that the compulsory license system
must be retained. They asserted that the record industry is a
half-billion-dollar business of great economic importance in the United
States and throughout the world; records today are the principal means of
disseminating music, and this creates special problems, since performers
need unhampered access to musical material on nondiscriminatory
terms. Historically, the record producers pointed out, there were no
recording rights before 1909 and the 1909 statute adopted the compulsory
license as a deliberate anti-monopoly condition on the grant of these
rights. They argue that the result has been an outpouring of recorded music,
with the public being given lower prices, improved quality, and a greater
choice.<sup>[<a name="id2688291" href="#ftn.id2688291" class="footnote">61</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
By limiting the rights musicians have, by partially pirating their creative
work, the record producers, and the public, benefit.

Radio was also born of piracy.
</p><p>
When a radio station plays a record on the air, that constitutes a "public
performance" of the composer's work.<sup>[<a name="id2688327" href="#ftn.id2688327" class="footnote">62</a>]</sup> As
I described above, the law gives the composer (or copyright holder)  an
exclusive right to public performances of his work. The radio station thus
owes the composer money for that performance.
</p><p>

But when the radio station plays a record, it is not only performing a copy
of the <span class="emphasis"><em>composer's</em></span> work. The radio station is also
performing a copy of the <span class="emphasis"><em>recording artist's</em></span> work. It's
one thing to have "Happy Birthday" sung on the radio by the local children's
choir; it's quite another to have it sung by the Rolling Stones or Lyle
Lovett. The recording artist is adding to the value of the composition
performed on the radio station.  And if the law were perfectly consistent,
the radio station would have to pay the recording artist for his work, just
as it pays the composer of the music for his work.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2688393"></a>


</p><p>
But it doesn't. Under the law governing radio performances, the radio
station does not have to pay the recording artist. The radio station need
only pay the composer. The radio station thus gets a bit of something for
nothing. It gets to perform the recording artist's work for free, even if it
must pay the composer something for the privilege of playing the song.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxmadonna"></a><p>
This difference can be huge. Imagine you compose a piece of music.  Imagine
it is your first. You own the exclusive right to authorize public
performances of that music. So if Madonna wants to sing your song in public,
she has to get your permission.
</p><p>
Imagine she does sing your song, and imagine she likes it a lot. She then
decides to make a recording of your song, and it becomes a top hit. Under
our law, every time a radio station plays your song, you get some money. But
Madonna gets nothing, save the indirect effect on the sale of her CDs. The
public performance of her recording is not a "protected" right. The radio
station thus gets to <span class="emphasis"><em>pirate</em></span> the value of Madonna's work
without paying her anything.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2688444"></a><p>
No doubt, one might argue that, on balance, the recording artists
benefit. On average, the promotion they get is worth more than the
performance rights they give up. Maybe. But even if so, the law ordinarily
gives the creator the right to make this choice. By making the choice for
him or her, the law gives the radio station the right to take something for
nothing.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Kabel-TV"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cabletv"></a>Kabel-TV</h2></div></div></div><p>

Cable TV was also born of a kind of piracy.
</p><p>

When cable entrepreneurs first started wiring communities with cable
television in 1948, most refused to pay broadcasters for the content that
they echoed to their customers. Even when the cable companies started
selling access to television broadcasts, they refused to pay for what they
sold. Cable companies were thus Napsterizing broadcasters' content, but more
egregiously than anything Napster ever did&#8212; Napster never charged for
the content it enabled others to give away.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2688479"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2688495"></a><p>
Broadcasters and copyright owners were quick to attack this theft.  Rosel
Hyde, chairman of the FCC, viewed the practice as a kind of "unfair and
potentially destructive competition."<sup>[<a name="id2688506" href="#ftn.id2688506" class="footnote">63</a>]</sup>
There may have been a "public interest" in spreading the reach of cable TV,
but as Douglas Anello, general counsel to the National Association of
Broadcasters, asked Senator Quentin Burdick during testimony, "Does public
interest dictate that you use somebody else's property?"<sup>[<a name="id2688522" href="#ftn.id2688522" class="footnote">64</a>]</sup> As another broadcaster put it,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The extraordinary thing about the CATV business is that it is the only
business I know of where the product that is being sold is not paid
for.<sup>[<a name="id2688539" href="#ftn.id2688539" class="footnote">65</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Igjen, kravene til opphavsrettsinnehaverne virket rimelige nok:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Alt vi ber om er en veldig enkel ting, at folk som tar vår eiendom gratis
betaler for den.  Vi forsøker å stoppe piratvirksomhet og jeg kan ikke tenke
på et svakere ord for å beskrive det.  Jeg tror det er sterkere ord som
ville passe.<sup>[<a name="id2688567" href="#ftn.id2688567" class="footnote">66</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Disse var "gratispassasjerer", sa presidenten Charlton Heston i Screen
Actor's Guild, som "tok lønna fra skuespillerne"<sup>[<a name="id2688585" href="#ftn.id2688585" class="footnote">67</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Men igjen, det er en annen side i debatten.  Som assisterende justisminister
Edwin Zimmerman sa det,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Our point here is that unlike the problem of whether you have any copyright
protection at all, the problem here is whether copyright holders who are
already compensated, who already have a monopoly, should be permitted to
extend that monopoly. . . . The question here is how much compensation they
should have and how far back they should carry their right to
compensation.<sup>[<a name="id2688612" href="#ftn.id2688612" class="footnote">68</a>]</sup> <a class="indexterm" name="id2688630"></a>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Opphavsrettinnehaverne tok kabelselskapene til retten. Høyesterett fant to
ganger at kabelselskaper ikke skyldte opphavsrettinnehaverne noen ting.
</p><p>
It took Congress almost thirty years before it resolved the question of
whether cable companies had to pay for the content they "pirated." In the
end, Congress resolved this question in the same way that it resolved the
question about record players and player pianos. Yes, cable companies would
have to pay for the content that they broadcast; but the price they would
have to pay was not set by the copyright owner.  The price was set by law,
so that the broadcasters couldn't exercise veto power over the emerging
technologies of cable. Cable companies thus built their empire in part upon
a "piracy" of the value created by broadcasters' content.
</p><p>
These separate stories sing a common theme. If "piracy" means using value
from someone else's creative property without permission from that
creator&#8212;as it is increasingly described today<sup>[<a name="id2688617" href="#ftn.id2688617" class="footnote">69</a>]</sup> &#8212; then <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> industry
affected by copyright today is the product and beneficiary of a certain kind
of piracy. Film, records, radio, cable TV. . . . The list is long and could
well be expanded. Every generation welcomes the pirates from the last. Every
generation&#8212;until now.

Kapittel fem: "Piratvirksomhet"</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Innholdsfortegnelse</b></p><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#piracy-i">Piracy I</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#piracy-ii">Piracy II</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>
There is piracy of copyrighted material. Lots of it. This piracy comes in
many forms. The most significant is commercial piracy, the unauthorized
taking of other people's content within a commercial context. Despite the
many justifications that are offered in its defense, this taking is
wrong. No one should condone it, and the law should stop it.
</p><p>

But as well as copy-shop piracy, there is another kind of "taking" that is
more directly related to the Internet. That taking, too, seems wrong to
many, and it is wrong much of the time. Before we paint this taking
"piracy," however, we should understand its nature a bit more.  For the harm
of this taking is significantly more ambiguous than outright copying, and
the law should account for that ambiguity, as it has so often done in the
past.

</p><div class="section" title="Piracy I"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="piracy-i"></a>Piracy I</h2></div></div></div><p>
All across the world, but especially in Asia and Eastern Europe, there are
businesses that do nothing but take others people's copyrighted content,
copy it, and sell it&#8212;all without the permission of a copyright
owner. The recording industry estimates that it loses about $4.6 billion
every year to physical piracy<sup>[<a name="id2688705" href="#ftn.id2688705" class="footnote">70</a>]</sup> (that
works out to one in three CDs sold worldwide). The MPAA estimates that it
loses $3 billion annually worldwide to piracy.
</p><p>
This is piracy plain and simple. Nothing in the argument of this book, nor
in the argument that most people make when talking about the subject of this
book, should draw into doubt this simple point: This piracy is wrong.
</p><p>
Which is not to say that excuses and justifications couldn't be made for
it. We could, for example, remind ourselves that for the first one hundred
years of the American Republic, America did not honor foreign copyrights. We
were born, in this sense, a pirate nation. It might therefore seem
hypocritical for us to insist so strongly that other developing nations
treat as wrong what we, for the first hundred years of our existence,
treated as right.
</p><p>
That excuse isn't terribly strong. Technically, our law did not ban the
taking of foreign works. It explicitly limited itself to American
works. Thus the American publishers who published foreign works without the
permission of foreign authors were not violating any rule.  The copy shops
in Asia, by contrast, are violating Asian law. Asian law does protect
foreign copyrights, and the actions of the copy shops violate that law. So
the wrong of piracy that they engage in is not just a moral wrong, but a
legal wrong, and not just an internationally legal wrong, but a locally
legal wrong as well.
</p><p>

True, these local rules have, in effect, been imposed upon these
countries. No country can be part of the world economy and choose not to
protect copyright internationally. We may have been born a pirate nation,
but we will not allow any other nation to have a similar childhood.
</p><p>
If a country is to be treated as a sovereign, however, then its laws are its
laws regardless of their source. The international law under which these
nations live gives them some opportunities to escape the burden of
intellectual property law.<sup>[<a name="id2688830" href="#ftn.id2688830" class="footnote">71</a>]</sup> In my view,
more developing nations should take advantage of that opportunity, but when
they don't, then their laws should be respected. And under the laws of these
nations, this piracy is wrong.
</p><p>
Alternatively, we could try to excuse this piracy by noting that in any
case, it does no harm to the industry. The Chinese who get access to
American CDs at 50 cents a copy are not people who would have bought those
American CDs at $15 a copy. So no one really has any less money than they
otherwise would have had.<sup>[<a name="id2688875" href="#ftn.id2688875" class="footnote">72</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
This is often true (though I have friends who have purchased many thousands
of pirated DVDs who certainly have enough money to pay for the content they
have taken), and it does mitigate to some degree the harm caused by such
taking. Extremists in this debate love to say, "You wouldn't go into Barnes
&amp; Noble and take a book off of the shelf without paying; why should it
be any different with on-line music?" The difference is, of course, that
when you take a book from Barnes &amp; Noble, it has one less book to
sell. By contrast, when you take an MP3 from a computer network, there is
not one less CD that can be sold.  The physics of piracy of the intangible
are different from the physics of piracy of the tangible.
</p><p>

This argument is still very weak. However, although copyright is a property
right of a very special sort, it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a property
right. Like all property rights, the copyright gives the owner the right to
decide the terms under which content is shared. If the copyright owner
doesn't want to sell, she doesn't have to. There are exceptions: important
statutory licenses that apply to copyrighted content regardless of the wish
of the copyright owner. Those licenses give people the right to "take"
copyrighted content whether or not the copyright owner wants to sell. But
where the law does not give people the right to take content, it is wrong to
take that content even if the wrong does no harm. If we have a property
system, and that system is properly balanced to the technology of a time,
then it is wrong to take property without the permission of a property
owner. That is exactly what "property" means.
</p><p>
Finally, we could try to excuse this piracy with the argument that the
piracy actually helps the copyright owner. When the Chinese "steal" Windows,
that makes the Chinese dependent on Microsoft.  Microsoft loses the value of
the software that was taken. But it gains users who are used to life in the
Microsoft world. Over time, as the nation grows more wealthy, more and more
people will buy software rather than steal it. And hence over time, because
that buying will benefit Microsoft, Microsoft benefits from the piracy. If
instead of pirating Microsoft Windows, the Chinese used the free GNU/Linux
operating system, then these Chinese users would not eventually be buying
Microsoft.  Without piracy, then, Microsoft would lose.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2688970"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2688977"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2688983"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2688994"></a>
</p><p>
This argument, too, is somewhat true. The addiction strategy is a good
one. Many businesses practice it. Some thrive because of it. Law students,
for example, are given free access to the two largest legal databases. The
companies marketing both hope the students will become so used to their
service that they will want to use it and not the other when they become
lawyers (and must pay high subscription fees).
</p><p>
Still, the argument is not terribly persuasive. We don't give the alcoholic
a defense when he steals his first beer, merely because that will make it
more likely that he will buy the next three. Instead, we ordinarily allow
businesses to decide for themselves when it is best to give their product
away. If Microsoft fears the competition of GNU/Linux, then Microsoft can
give its product away, as it did, for example, with Internet Explorer to
fight Netscape. A property right means giving the property owner the right
to say who gets access to what&#8212;at least ordinarily. And if the law
properly balances the rights of the copyright owner with the rights of
access, then violating the law is still wrong.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2688753"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2689019"></a>
</p><p>


Thus, while I understand the pull of these justifications for piracy, and I
certainly see the motivation, in my view, in the end, these efforts at
justifying commercial piracy simply don't cut it. This kind of piracy is
rampant and just plain wrong. It doesn't transform the content it steals; it
doesn't transform the market it competes in. It merely gives someone access
to something that the law says he should not have.  Nothing has changed to
draw that law into doubt. This form of piracy is flat out wrong.
</p><p>
But as the examples from the four chapters that introduced this part
suggest, even if some piracy is plainly wrong, not all "piracy" is. Or at
least, not all "piracy" is wrong if that term is understood in the way it is
increasingly used today. Many kinds of "piracy" are useful and productive,
to produce either new content or new ways of doing business.  Neither our
tradition nor any tradition has ever banned all "piracy" in that sense of
the term.
</p><p>
This doesn't mean that there are no questions raised by the latest piracy
concern, peer-to-peer file sharing. But it does mean that we need to
understand the harm in peer-to-peer sharing a bit more before we condemn it
to the gallows with the charge of piracy.
</p><p>
For (1) like the original Hollywood, p2p sharing escapes an overly
controlling industry; and (2) like the original recording industry, it
simply exploits a new way to distribute content; but (3) unlike cable TV, no
one is selling the content that is shared on p2p services.
</p><p>
These differences distinguish p2p sharing from true piracy. They should push
us to find a way to protect artists while enabling this sharing to survive.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Piracy II"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="piracy-ii"></a>Piracy II</h2></div></div></div><p>

The key to the "piracy" that the law aims to quash is a use that "rob[s] the
author of [his] profit."<sup>[<a name="id2689102" href="#ftn.id2689102" class="footnote">73</a>]</sup> This means we
must determine whether and how much p2p sharing harms before we know how
strongly the law should seek to either prevent it or find an alternative to
assure the author of his profit.
</p><p>
Peer-to-peer sharing was made famous by Napster. But the inventors of the
Napster technology had not made any major technological innovations.  Like
every great advance in innovation on the Internet (and, arguably, off the
Internet as well<sup>[<a name="id2689125" href="#ftn.id2689125" class="footnote">74</a>]</sup>), Shawn Fanning and
crew had simply put together components that had been developed
independently.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2689155"></a>
</p><p>
The result was spontaneous combustion. Launched in July 1999, Napster
amassed over 10 million users within nine months. After eighteen months,
there were close to 80 million registered users of the system.<sup>[<a name="id2689168" href="#ftn.id2689168" class="footnote">75</a>]</sup> Courts quickly shut Napster down, but other
services emerged to take its place. (Kazaa is currently the most popular p2p
service. It boasts over 100 million members.) These services' systems are
different architecturally, though not very different in function: Each
enables users to make content available to any number of other users. With a
p2p system, you can share your favorite songs with your best friend&#8212;
or your 20,000 best friends.
</p><p>
According to a number of estimates, a huge proportion of Americans have
tasted file-sharing technology. A study by Ipsos-Insight in September 2002
estimated that 60 million Americans had downloaded music&#8212;28 percent of
Americans older than 12.<sup>[<a name="id2689203" href="#ftn.id2689203" class="footnote">76</a>]</sup> A survey by
the NPD group quoted in <em class="citetitle">The New York Times</em> estimated
that 43 million citizens used file-sharing networks to exchange content in
May 2003.<sup>[<a name="id2689231" href="#ftn.id2689231" class="footnote">77</a>]</sup> The vast majority of these
are not kids. Whatever the actual figure, a massive quantity of content is
being "taken" on these networks. The ease and inexpensiveness of
file-sharing networks have inspired millions to enjoy music in a way that
they hadn't before.
</p><p>
Some of this enjoying involves copyright infringement. Some of it does
not. And even among the part that is technically copyright infringement,
calculating the actual harm to copyright owners is more complicated than one
might think. So consider&#8212;a bit more carefully than the polarized
voices around this debate usually do&#8212;the kinds of sharing that file
sharing enables, and the kinds of harm it entails.

There are some who use sharing networks as substitutes for purchasing
content. Thus, when a new Madonna CD is released, rather than buying the CD,
these users simply take it. We might quibble about whether everyone who
takes it would actually have bought it if sharing didn't make it available
for free. Most probably wouldn't have, but clearly there are some who
would.  The latter are the target of category A: users who download instead
of purchasing.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2689284"></a>
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>


There are some who use sharing networks to sample music before purchasing
it. Thus, a friend sends another friend an MP3 of an artist he's not heard
of. The other friend then buys CDs by that artist. This is a kind of
targeted advertising, quite likely to succeed.  If the friend recommending
the album gains nothing from a bad recommendation, then one could expect
that the recommendations will actually be quite good. The net effect of this
sharing could increase the quantity of music purchased.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>


There are many who use sharing networks to get access to copyrighted content
that is no longer sold or that they would not have purchased because the
transaction costs off the Net are too high. This use of sharing networks is
among the most rewarding for many. Songs that were part of your childhood
but have long vanished from the marketplace magically appear again on the
network. (One friend told me that when she discovered Napster, she spent a
solid weekend "recalling" old songs. She was astonished at the range and mix
of content that was available.)  For content not sold, this is still
technically a violation of copyright, though because the copyright owner is
not selling the content anymore, the economic harm is zero&#8212;the same
harm that occurs when I sell my collection of 1960s 45-rpm records to a
local collector.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>




Finally, there are many who use sharing networks to get access to content
that is not copyrighted or that the copyright owner wants to give away.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Hvordan balanserer disse ulike delingstypene?
</p><p>
Let's start with some simple but important points. From the perspective of
the law, only type D sharing is clearly legal. From the perspective of
economics, only type A sharing is clearly harmful.<sup>[<a name="id2689353" href="#ftn.id2689353" class="footnote">78</a>]</sup> Type B sharing is illegal but plainly
beneficial. Type C sharing is illegal, yet good for society (since more
exposure to music is good)  and harmless to the artist (since the work is
not otherwise available). So how sharing matters on balance is a hard
question to answer&#8212;and certainly much more difficult than the current
rhetoric around the issue suggests.
</p><p>
Whether on balance sharing is harmful depends importantly on how harmful
type A sharing is. Just as Edison complained about Hollywood, composers
complained about piano rolls, recording artists complained about radio, and
broadcasters complained about cable TV, the music industry complains that
type A sharing is a kind of "theft" that is "devastating" the industry.
</p><p>
While the numbers do suggest that sharing is harmful, how harmful is harder
to reckon. It has long been the recording industry's practice to blame
technology for any drop in sales. The history of cassette recording is a
good example. As a study by Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young put it, "Rather
than exploiting this new, popular technology, the labels fought
it."<sup>[<a name="id2689398" href="#ftn.id2689398" class="footnote">79</a>]</sup> The labels claimed that every
album taped was an album unsold, and when record sales fell by 11.4 percent
in 1981, the industry claimed that its point was proved. Technology was the
problem, and banning or regulating technology was the answer.
</p><p>
Yet soon thereafter, and before Congress was given an opportunity to enact
regulation, MTV was launched, and the industry had a record turnaround. "In
the end," Cap Gemini concludes, "the `crisis' . . . was not the fault of the
tapers&#8212;who did not [stop after MTV came into being]&#8212;but had to a
large extent resulted from stagnation in musical innovation at the major
labels."<sup>[<a name="id2689436" href="#ftn.id2689436" class="footnote">80</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
But just because the industry was wrong before does not mean it is wrong
today. To evaluate the real threat that p2p sharing presents to the industry
in particular, and society in general&#8212;or at least the society that
inherits the tradition that gave us the film industry, the record industry,
the radio industry, cable TV, and the VCR&#8212;the question is not simply
whether type A sharing is harmful. The question is also
<span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> harmful type A sharing is, and how beneficial the
other types of sharing are.
</p><p>
We start to answer this question by focusing on the net harm, from the
standpoint of the industry as a whole, that sharing networks cause.  The
"net harm" to the industry as a whole is the amount by which type A sharing
exceeds type B. If the record companies sold more records through sampling
than they lost through substitution, then sharing networks would actually
benefit music companies on balance. They would therefore have little
<span class="emphasis"><em>static</em></span> reason to resist them.

</p><p>
Could that be true? Could the industry as a whole be gaining because of file
sharing? Odd as that might sound, the data about CD sales actually suggest
it might be close.
</p><p>
In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9 percent, from 882
million to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7 percent.<sup>[<a name="id2689499" href="#ftn.id2689499" class="footnote">81</a>]</sup> This confirms a trend over the past few years. The
RIAA blames Internet piracy for the trend, though there are many other
causes that could account for this drop. SoundScan, for example, reports a
more than 20 percent drop in the number of CDs released since 1999. That no
doubt accounts for some of the decrease in sales. Rising prices could
account for at least some of the loss. "From 1999 to 2001, the average price
of a CD rose 7.2 percent, from $13.04 to $14.19."<sup>[<a name="id2689543" href="#ftn.id2689543" class="footnote">82</a>]</sup> Competition from other forms of media could also
account for some of the decline. As Jane Black of
<em class="citetitle">BusinessWeek</em> notes, "The soundtrack to the film
<em class="citetitle">High Fidelity</em> has a list price of $18.98. You could
get the whole movie [on DVD] for $19.99."<sup>[<a name="id2689576" href="#ftn.id2689576" class="footnote">83</a>]</sup>
</p><p>



But let's assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD sales is
because of Internet sharing. Here's the rub: In the same period that the
RIAA estimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the RIAA estimates that 2.1
billion CDs were downloaded for free. Thus, although 2.6 times the total
number of CDs sold were downloaded for free, sales revenue fell by just 6.7
percent.
</p><p>
There are too many different things happening at the same time to explain
these numbers definitively, but one conclusion is unavoidable: The recording
industry constantly asks, "What's the difference between downloading a song
and stealing a CD?"&#8212;but their own numbers reveal the difference. If I
steal a CD, then there is one less CD to sell. Every taking is a lost
sale. But on the basis of the numbers the RIAA provides, it is absolutely
clear that the same is not true of downloads. If every download were a lost
sale&#8212;if every use of Kazaa "rob[bed] the author of [his]
profit"&#8212;then the industry would have suffered a 100 percent drop in
sales last year, not a 7 percent drop. If 2.6 times the number of CDs sold
were downloaded for free, and yet sales revenue dropped by just 6.7 percent,
then there is a huge difference between "downloading a song and stealing a
CD."
</p><p>
These are the harms&#8212;alleged and perhaps exaggerated but, let's assume,
real. What of the benefits? File sharing may impose costs on the recording
industry. What value does it produce in addition to these costs?
</p><p>
One benefit is type C sharing&#8212;making available content that is
technically still under copyright but is no longer commercially available.
This is not a small category of content. There are millions of tracks that
are no longer commercially available.<sup>[<a name="id2689600" href="#ftn.id2689600" class="footnote">84</a>]</sup>
And while it's conceivable that some of this content is not available
because the artist producing the content doesn't want it to be made
available, the vast majority of it is unavailable solely because the
publisher or the distributor has decided it no longer makes economic sense
<span class="emphasis"><em>to the company</em></span> to make it available.
</p><p>
In real space&#8212;long before the Internet&#8212;the market had a simple
response to this problem: used book and record stores. There are thousands
of used book and used record stores in America today.<sup>[<a name="id2689657" href="#ftn.id2689657" class="footnote">85</a>]</sup> These stores buy content from owners, then sell the
content they buy. And under American copyright law, when they buy and sell
this content, <span class="emphasis"><em>even if the content is still under
copyright</em></span>, the copyright owner doesn't get a dime. Used book and
record stores are commercial entities; their owners make money from the
content they sell; but as with cable companies before statutory licensing,
they don't have to pay the copyright owner for the content they sell.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2689704"></a><p>
Type C sharing, then, is very much like used book stores or used record
stores. It is different, of course, because the person making the content
available isn't making money from making the content available.  It is also
different, of course, because in real space, when I sell a record, I don't
have it anymore, while in cyberspace, when someone shares my 1949 recording
of Bernstein's "Two Love Songs," I still have it. That difference would
matter economically if the owner of the copyright were selling the record in
competition to my sharing. But we're talking about the class of content that
is not currently commercially available. The Internet is making it
available, through cooperative sharing, without competing with the market.
</p><p>
It may well be, all things considered, that it would be better if the
copyright owner got something from this trade. But just because it may well
be better, it doesn't follow that it would be good to ban used book
stores. Or put differently, if you think that type C sharing should be
stopped, do you think that libraries and used book stores should be shut as
well?
</p><p>

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, file-sharing networks enable type D
sharing to occur&#8212;the sharing of content that copyright owners want to
have shared or for which there is no continuing copyright. This sharing
clearly benefits authors and society. Science fiction author Cory Doctorow,
for example, released his first novel, <em class="citetitle">Down and Out in the Magic
Kingdom</em>, both free on-line and in bookstores on the same
day. His (and his publisher's) thinking was that the on-line distribution
would be a great advertisement for the "real" book. People would read part
on-line, and then decide whether they liked the book or not. If they liked
it, they would be more likely to buy it. Doctorow's content is type D
content. If sharing networks enable his work to be spread, then both he and
society are better off. (Actually, much better off: It is a great book!)
</p><p>
Likewise for work in the public domain: This sharing benefits society with
no legal harm to authors at all. If efforts to solve the problem of type A
sharing destroy the opportunity for type D sharing, then we lose something
important in order to protect type A content.
</p><p>
The point throughout is this: While the recording industry understandably
says, "This is how much we've lost," we must also ask, "How much has society
gained from p2p sharing? What are the efficiencies? What is the content that
otherwise would be unavailable?"
</p><p>
For unlike the piracy I described in the first section of this chapter, much
of the "piracy" that file sharing enables is plainly legal and good.  And
like the piracy I described in chapter <a class="xref" href="#pirates" title='Kapittel 5. Kapittel fire: "Pirater"'>5</a>, much of this piracy is motivated by a new way of
spreading content caused by changes in the technology of distribution. Thus,
consistent with the tradition that gave us Hollywood, radio, the recording
industry, and cable TV, the question we should be asking about file sharing
is how best to preserve its benefits while minimizing (to the extent
possible) the wrongful harm it causes artists. The question is one of
balance. The law should seek that balance, and that balance will be found
only with time.
</p><p>
Men er ikke krigen bare en krig mot ulovlig deling?  Er ikke angrepsmålet
bare det du kaller type A-deling?
</p><p>
You would think. And we should hope. But so far, it is not. The effect of
the war purportedly on type A sharing alone has been felt far beyond that
one class of sharing. That much is obvious from the Napster case
itself. When Napster told the district court that it had developed a
technology to block the transfer of 99.4 percent of identified infringing
material, the district court told counsel for Napster 99.4 percent was not
good enough. Napster had to push the infringements "down to
zero."<sup>[<a name="id2689813" href="#ftn.id2689813" class="footnote">86</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
If 99.4 percent is not good enough, then this is a war on file-sharing
technologies, not a war on copyright infringement. There is no way to assure
that a p2p system is used 100 percent of the time in compliance with the
law, any more than there is a way to assure that 100 percent of VCRs or 100
percent of Xerox machines or 100 percent of handguns are used in compliance
with the law. Zero tolerance means zero p2p.  The court's ruling means that
we as a society must lose the benefits of p2p, even for the totally legal
and beneficial uses they serve, simply to assure that there are zero
copyright infringements caused by p2p.
</p><p>
Zero tolerance has not been our history. It has not produced the content
industry that we know today. The history of American law has been a process
of balance. As new technologies changed the way content was distributed, the
law adjusted, after some time, to the new technology.  In this adjustment,
the law sought to ensure the legitimate rights of creators while protecting
innovation. Sometimes this has meant more rights for creators. Sometimes
less.
</p><p>
So, as we've seen, when "mechanical reproduction" threatened the interests
of composers, Congress balanced the rights of composers against the
interests of the recording industry. It granted rights to composers, but
also to the recording artists: Composers were to be paid, but at a price set
by Congress. But when radio started broadcasting the recordings made by
these recording artists, and they complained to Congress that their
"creative property" was not being respected (since the radio station did not
have to pay them for the creativity it broadcast), Congress rejected their
claim. An indirect benefit was enough.
</p><p>
Cable TV followed the pattern of record albums. When the courts rejected the
claim that cable broadcasters had to pay for the content they rebroadcast,
Congress responded by giving broadcasters a right to compensation, but at a
level set by the law. It likewise gave cable companies the right to the
content, so long as they paid the statutory price.
</p><p>



This compromise, like the compromise affecting records and player pianos,
served two important goals&#8212;indeed, the two central goals of any
copyright legislation. First, the law assured that new innovators would have
the freedom to develop new ways to deliver content.  Second, the law assured
that copyright holders would be paid for the content that was
distributed. One fear was that if Congress simply required cable TV to pay
copyright holders whatever they demanded for their content, then copyright
holders associated with broadcasters would use their power to stifle this
new technology, cable. But if Congress had permitted cable to use
broadcasters' content for free, then it would have unfairly subsidized
cable. Thus Congress chose a path that would assure
<span class="emphasis"><em>compensation</em></span> without giving the past (broadcasters)
control over the future (cable).
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2689910"></a><p>
In the same year that Congress struck this balance, two major producers and
distributors of film content filed a lawsuit against another technology, the
video tape recorder (VTR, or as we refer to them today, VCRs) that Sony had
produced, the Betamax. Disney's and Universal's claim against Sony was
relatively simple: Sony produced a device, Disney and Universal claimed,
that enabled consumers to engage in copyright infringement. Because the
device that Sony built had a "record" button, the device could be used to
record copyrighted movies and shows. Sony was therefore benefiting from the
copyright infringement of its customers. It should therefore, Disney and
Universal claimed, be partially liable for that infringement.
</p><p>

There was something to Disney's and Universal's claim. Sony did decide to
design its machine to make it very simple to record television shows. It
could have built the machine to block or inhibit any direct copying from a
television broadcast. Or possibly, it could have built the machine to copy
only if there were a special "copy me" signal on the line. It was clear that
there were many television shows that did not grant anyone permission to
copy. Indeed, if anyone had asked, no doubt the majority of shows would not
have authorized copying. And in the face of this obvious preference, Sony
could have designed its system to minimize the opportunity for copyright
infringement. It did not, and for that, Disney and Universal wanted to hold
it responsible for the architecture it chose.
</p><p>
MPAA president Jack Valenti became the studios' most vocal champion. Valenti
called VCRs "tapeworms." He warned, "When there are 20, 30, 40 million of
these VCRs in the land, we will be invaded by millions of `tapeworms,'
eating away at the very heart and essence of the most precious asset the
copyright owner has, his copyright."<sup>[<a name="id2689958" href="#ftn.id2689958" class="footnote">87</a>]</sup>
"One does not have to be trained in sophisticated marketing and creative
judgment," he told Congress, "to understand the devastation on the
after-theater marketplace caused by the hundreds of millions of tapings that
will adversely impact on the future of the creative community in this
country. It is simply a question of basic economics and plain common
sense."<sup>[<a name="id2689975" href="#ftn.id2689975" class="footnote">88</a>]</sup> Indeed, as surveys would later
show, percent of VCR owners had movie libraries of ten videos or
more<sup>[<a name="id2689984" href="#ftn.id2689984" class="footnote">89</a>]</sup> &#8212; a use the Court would
later hold was not "fair." By "allowing VCR owners to copy freely by the
means of an exemption from copyright infringementwithout creating a
mechanism to compensate copyrightowners," Valenti testified, Congress would
"take from the owners the very essence of their property: the exclusive
right to control who may use their work, that is, who may copy it and
thereby profit from its reproduction."<sup>[<a name="id2689892" href="#ftn.id2689892" class="footnote">90</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
It took eight years for this case to be resolved by the Supreme Court. In
the interim, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Hollywood in
its jurisdiction&#8212;leading Judge Alex Kozinski, who sits on that court,
refers to it as the "Hollywood Circuit"&#8212;held that Sony would be liable
for the copyright infringement made possible by its machines. Under the
Ninth Circuit's rule, this totally familiar technology&#8212;which Jack
Valenti had called "the Boston Strangler of the American film industry"
(worse yet, it was a <span class="emphasis"><em>Japanese</em></span> Boston Strangler of the
American film industry)&#8212;was an illegal technology.<sup>[<a name="id2690018" href="#ftn.id2690018" class="footnote">91</a>]</sup>
</p><p>

But the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit.  And in
its reversal, the Court clearly articulated its understanding of when and
whether courts should intervene in such disputes. As the Court wrote,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Sound policy, as well as history, supports our consistent deference to
Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for
copyrighted materials. Congress has the constitutional authority and the
institutional ability to accommodate fully the varied permutations of
competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new
technology.<sup>[<a name="id2690064" href="#ftn.id2690064" class="footnote">92</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Congress was asked to respond to the Supreme Court's decision.  But as with
the plea of recording artists about radio broadcasts, Congress ignored the
request. Congress was convinced that American film got enough, this "taking"
notwithstanding.  If we put these cases together, a pattern is clear:
</p><div class="table"><a name="t1"></a><p class="title"><b>Tabell 6.1.

In each case throughout our history, a new technology changed the way
content was distributed.<sup>[<a name="id2690194" href="#ftn.id2690194" class="footnote">93</a>]</sup> In each case,
throughout our history, that change meant that someone got a "free ride" on
someone else's work.
</p><p>

In <span class="emphasis"><em>none</em></span> of these cases did either the courts or
Congress eliminate all free riding. In <span class="emphasis"><em>none</em></span> of these
cases did the courts or Congress insist that the law should assure that the
copyright holder get all the value that his copyright created. In every
case, the copyright owners complained of "piracy." In every case, Congress
acted to recognize some of the legitimacy in the behavior of the "pirates."
In each case, Congress allowed some new technology to benefit from content
made before. It balanced the interests at stake.

</p><p>
When you think across these examples, and the other examples that make up
the first four chapters of this section, this balance makes sense. Was Walt
Disney a pirate? Would doujinshi be better if creators had to ask
permission? Should tools that enable others to capture and spread images as
a way to cultivate or criticize our culture be better regulated? Is it
really right that building a search engine should expose you to $15 million
in damages? Would it have been better if Edison had controlled film? Should
every cover band have to hire a lawyer to get permission to record a song?
</p><p>
We could answer yes to each of these questions, but our tradition has
answered no. In our tradition, as the Supreme Court has stated, copyright
"has never accorded the copyright owner complete control over all possible
uses of his work."<sup>[<a name="id2690275" href="#ftn.id2690275" class="footnote">94</a>]</sup> Instead, the
particular uses that the law regulates have been defined by balancing the
good that comes from granting an exclusive right against the burdens such an
exclusive right creates. And this balancing has historically been done
<span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> a technology has matured, or settled into the mix
of technologies that facilitate the distribution of content.
</p><p>
We should be doing the same thing today. The technology of the Internet is
changing quickly. The way people connect to the Internet (wires
vs. wireless) is changing very quickly. No doubt the network should not
become a tool for "stealing" from artists. But neither should the law become
a tool to entrench one particular way in which artists (or more accurately,
distributors) get paid. As I describe in some detail in the last chapter of
this book, we should be securing income to artists while we allow the market
to secure the most efficient way to promote and distribute content. This
will require changes in the law, at least in the interim. These changes
should be designed to balance the protection of the law against the strong
public interest that innovation continue.
</p><p>


This is especially true when a new technology enables a vastly superior mode
of distribution. And this p2p has done. P2p technologies can be ideally
efficient in moving content across a widely diverse network.  Left to
develop, they could make the network vastly more efficient.  Yet these
"potential public benefits," as John Schwartz writes in <em class="citetitle">The New
York Times</em>, "could be delayed in the P2P fight."<sup>[<a name="id2690339" href="#ftn.id2690339" class="footnote">95</a>]</sup> Yet when anyone begins to talk about "balance," the
copyright warriors raise a different argument. "All this hand waving about
balance and incentives," they say, "misses a fundamental point. Our
content," the warriors insist, "is our <span class="emphasis"><em>property</em></span>. Why
should we wait for Congress to `rebalance' our property rights? Do you have
to wait before calling the police when your car has been stolen? And why
should Congress deliberate at all about the merits of this theft? Do we ask
whether the car thief had a good use for the car before we arrest him?"
</p><p>
"It is <span class="emphasis"><em>our property</em></span>," the warriors insist. "And it
should be protected just as any other property is protected."

administrative and enforcement mechanisms for intellectual property rights,
a costly proposition for developing countries. Additionally, patent rights
may lead to higher prices for staple industries such as agriculture. Critics
of TRIPS question the disparity between burdens imposed upon developing
countries and benefits conferred to industrialized nations. TRIPS does
permit governments to use patents for public, noncommercial uses without
first obtaining the patent holder's permission. Developing nations may be
able to use this to gain the benefits of foreign patents at lower
prices. This is a promising strategy for developing nations within the TRIPS

These are the most important instances in our history, but there are other
cases as well. The technology of digital audio tape (DAT), for example, was
regulated by Congress to minimize the risk of piracy. The remedy Congress
imposed did burden DAT producers, by taxing tape sales and controlling the
technology of DAT. See Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 (Title 17 of the
<em class="citetitle">United States Code</em>), Pub. L. No. 102-563, 106 Stat.

The copyright warriors are right: A copyright is a kind of property. It can
be owned and sold, and the law protects against its theft. Ordinarily, the
copyright owner gets to hold out for any price he wants. Markets reckon the
supply and demand that partially determine the price she can get.
</p><p>
But in ordinary language, to call a copyright a "property" right is a bit
misleading, for the property of copyright is an odd kind of property.
Indeed, the very idea of property in any idea or any expression is very
odd. I understand what I am taking when I take the picnic table you put in
your backyard. I am taking a thing, the picnic table, and after I take it,
you don't have it. But what am I taking when I take the good
<span class="emphasis"><em>idea</em></span> you had to put a picnic table in the
backyard&#8212;by, for example, going to Sears, buying a table, and putting
it in my backyard? What is the thing I am taking then?
</p><p>
The point is not just about the thingness of picnic tables versus ideas,
though that's an important difference. The point instead is that in the
ordinary case&#8212;indeed, in practically every case except for a narrow
range of exceptions&#8212;ideas released to the world are free. I don't take
anything from you when I copy the way you dress&#8212;though I might seem
weird if I did it every day, and especially weird if you are a
woman. Instead, as Thomas Jefferson said (and as is especially true when I
copy the way someone else dresses), "He who receives an idea from me,
receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his
taper at mine, receives light without darkening me."<sup>[<a name="id2690413" href="#ftn.id2690413" class="footnote">96</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
The exceptions to free use are ideas and expressions within the reach of the
law of patent and copyright, and a few other domains that I won't discuss
here. Here the law says you can't take my idea or expression without my
permission: The law turns the intangible into property.
</p><p>
But how, and to what extent, and in what form&#8212;the details, in other
words&#8212;matter. To get a good sense of how this practice of turning the
intangible into property emerged, we need to place this "property" in its
proper context.<sup>[<a name="id2690458" href="#ftn.id2690458" class="footnote">97</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
My strategy in doing this will be the same as my strategy in the preceding
part. I offer four stories to help put the idea of "copyright material is
property" in context. Where did the idea come from? What are its limits? How
does it function in practice? After these stories, the significance of this
true statement&#8212;"copyright material is property"&#8212; will be a bit
more clear, and its implications will be revealed as quite different from
the implications that the copyright warriors would have us draw.

As the legal realists taught American law, all property rights are
intangible.  A property right is simply a right that an individual has
against the world to do or not do certain things that may or may not attach
to a physical object. The right itself is intangible, even if the object to
which it is (metaphorically) attached is tangible. See Adam Mossoff, "What
Is Property? Putting the Pieces Back Together," <em class="citetitle">Arizona Law
Review</em> 45 (2003): 373, 429 n. 241.

William Shakespeare skrev <em class="citetitle">Romeo og Julie</em> i
1595. Skuespillet ble først utgitt i 1597. Det var det ellevte store
skuespillet Shakespeare hadde skrevet. Han fortsatte å skrive skuespill helt
til 1613, og stykkene han skrevhar fortsatt å definere angloamerikansk
kultur siden. Så dypt har verkene av en 1500-talls forfatter sunket inn i
vår kultur at vi ofte ikke engang kjenner kilden. Jeg overhørte en gang noen
som kommentere Kenneth Branaghs utgave av Henry V: "Jeg likte det, men
Shakespeare er så full av klisjeer."
</p><p>

I 1774, nesten 180 år etter at <em class="citetitle">Romeo og Julie</em> ble
skrevet, mente mange at "opphavsretten" kun tilhørte én eneste utgiver i
London, John Tonson. <sup>[<a name="id2690534" href="#ftn.id2690534" class="footnote">98</a>]</sup> Tonson var den
mest fremstående av en liten gruppe utgivere kalt "the Conger"<sup>[<a name="id2690564" href="#ftn.id2690564" class="footnote">99</a>]</sup>, som kontrollerte boksalget i England gjennom hele
1700-tallet. The Conger hevdet at de hadde en evigvarende rett over "kopier"
av bøker de hadde fått av forfatterne. Denne evigvarende retten innebar at
ingen andre kunne publisere kopier av disse bøkene. Slik ble prisen på
klassiske bøker holdt oppe; alle konkurrenter som lagde bedre eller
billigere utgaver, ble fjernet.
</p><p>
Men altså, det er noe spennende med året 1774 for alle som vet litt om
opphavsretts-lovgivning. Det mest kjente året for opphavsrett er 1710, da
det britiske parlamentet vedtok den første loven. Denne loven er kjent som
"Statute of Anne" og sa at alle publiserte verk skulle være beskyttet i
fjorten år, en periode som kunne fornyes én gang dersom forfatteren ennå
levde, og at alle verk publisert i eller før 1710 skulle ha en ekstraperiode
på 22 tillegsår.<sup>[<a name="id2690601" href="#ftn.id2690601" class="footnote">100</a>]</sup> På grunn av denne
loven, så skulle <em class="citetitle">Rome og Julie</em> ha falt i det fri i
1731. Hvordan kunne da Tonson fortsatt ha kontroll over verket i 1774?
</p><p>
Årsaken var ganske enkelt at engelskmennene ennå ikke hadde bestemt hva
opphavsrett innebar -- faktisk hadde ingen i verden det. På den tiden da
engelskmennene vedtok "Statute of Anne", var det ingen annen lovgivning om
opphavsrett. Den siste loven som regulerte utgivere var lisensieringsloven
av 1662, utløpt i 1695. At loven ga utgiverne monopol over publiseringen,
noe som gjorde det enklere for kronen å kontrollere hva ble publisert. Men
etter at det har utløpt, var det ingen positiv lov som sa at utgiverne hadde
en eksklusiv rett til å trykke bøker.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2690641"></a>
</p><p>
At det ikke fantes noen <span class="emphasis"><em>positiv</em></span> lov, betydde ikke at
det ikke fantes noen lov. Den anglo-amerikanske juridiske tradisjon ser både
til lover skapt av politikere (det lovgivende statsorgen)og til lover
(prejudikater) skapt av domstolene for å bestemme hvordan folket skal
leve. Vi kaller politikernes lover for positiv lov og vi kaller lovene fra
dommerne sedvanerett."Common law" angir bakgrunnen for de lovgivendes
lovgivning; retten til lovgiving, vanligvis kan trumfe at bakgrunnen bare
hvis det går gjennom en lov til å forskyve den. Og så var det virkelige
spørsmålet etter lisensiering lover hadde utløpt om felles lov beskyttet
opphavsretten, uavhengig av lovverket positiv.
</p><p>

Dette spørsmålet var viktig for utgiverne eller "bokselgere," som de ble
kalt, fordi det var økende konkurranse fra utenlandske utgivere, Særlig fra
Skottland hvor publiseringen og eksporten av bøker til England hadde økt
veldig. Denne konkurransen reduserte fortjenesten til "The Conger", som
derfor krevde at parlamentet igjen skulle vedta en lov for å gi dem
eksklusiv kontroll over publisering. Dette kravet resulterte i "Statute of
Anne".
</p><p>
"Statute of Anne" ga forfatteren eller "eieren" av en bok en eksklusiv rett
til å publisere denne boken. Men det var, til bokhandernes forferdelse en
viktig begrensning, nemlig hvor lenge denne retten skulle vare. Etter dette
gikk trykkeretten bort og verket falt i det fri og kunne trykkes av hvem som
helst. Det var ihvertfall det lovgiverne hadde tenkt.
</p><p>
Men nå det mest interessante med dette: Hvorfor ville parlamentet begrense
trykkeretten? Sprøsmålet er ikke hvorfor de bestemte seg for denne perioden,
men hvorfor ville de begrense retten <span class="emphasis"><em>i det hele tatt?</em></span>
</p><p>
Bokhandlerne, og forfatterne som de representerte, hadde et veldig sterkt
krav. Ta <em class="citetitle">romeo og Julie</em> som et eksempel: Skuespillet
ble skrevet av Shakespeare. Det var hans kreativitet som brakte det til
verden. Han krenket ikke noens rett da han skrev dette verket (det er en
kontroversiell påstanden, men det er urelevant), og med sin egen rett skapte
han verket, han gjorde det ikke noe vanskeligere for andre til å lage
skuespill. Så hvorfor skulle loven tillate at noen annen kunne komme og ta
Shakespeares verkuten hans, eller hans arvingers, tillatelse? Hvilke grunner
finnes for å tillate at noen "stjeler" Shakespeares verk?
</p><p>
Svaret er todel. Først må vi se på noe spesielt med oppfatningen av
opphavsrett som fantes på tidspunktet da "Statute of Anne" ble
vedtatt. Deretter må vi se på noe spesielt med bokhandlerne.
</p><p>

Først om opphavsretten. I de siste tre hundre år har vi kommet til å bruke
begrepet "copyright" i stadig videre forstand. Men i 1710 var det ikke så
mye et konsept som det var en bestemt rett. Opphavsretten ble født som et
svært spesifikt sett med begrensninger: den forbød andre å reprodusere en
bok. I 1710 var "kopi-rett" en rett til å bruke en bestemt maskin til å
replikere en bestemt arbeid. Den gikk ikke utover dette svært smale
formålet. Den kontrollerte ikke mer generelt hvordan et verk kunne
<span class="emphasis"><em>brukes</em></span>. Idag inkluderer retten en stor samling av
restriksjoner på andres frihet: den gir forfatteren eksklusiv rett til å
kopiere, eksklusiv rett til å distribuere, eksklusiv rett til å fremføre, og
så videre.
</p><p>
Så selv om f. eks. opphavsretten til Shakespeares verker var evigvarende,
betydde det under den opprinnelige betydningen av begrepet at ingen kunne
trykke Shakespeares arbeid uten tillatelse fra Shakespeares arvinger. Den
ville ikke ha kontrollert noe mer, for eksempel om hvordan verket kunne
fremføres, om verket kunne oversettes eller om Kenneth Branagh ville hatt
lov til å lage filmer. "Kopi-retten" var bare en eksklusiv rett til å
trykke--ikke noe mindre, selvfølgelig, men heller ikke mer.
</p><p>
Selv dnne begrensede retten ble møtt med skepsis av britene. De hadde hatt
en lang og stygg erfaring med "eksklusive rettigheter," spesielt "enerett"
gitt av kronen. Engelskmennene hadde utkjempet en borgerkrig delvis mot
kronens praksis med å dele ut monopoler--spesielt monopoler for verk som
allerede eksisterte. Kong Henrik VIII hadde gitt patent til å trykke Bibelen
og monopol til Darcy for å lage spillkort. Det engelske parlamentet begynte
å kjempe tilbake mot denne makten hos kronen. I 1656 ble "Statute of
Monopolis" vedtatt for å begrense monopolene på patenter for nye
oppfinnelser. Og i 1710 var parlamentet ivrig etter å håndtere det voksende
monopolet på publisering.
</p><p>
Dermed ble "kopi-retten", når den sees på som en monopolrett, en rettighet
som bør være begrenset. (Uansett hvor overbevisende påstanden om at "det er
min eiendom, og jeg skal ha for alltid," prøv hvor overbevisende det er når
men sier "det er mitt monopol, og jeg skal ha det for alltid.") Staten ville
beskytte eneretten, men bare så lenge det gavnet samfunnet. Britene så
skadene særinteresserte kunne skape; de vedtok en lov for å stoppe dem.
</p><p>
Dernest, om bokhandlerne. Det var ikke bare at kopiretten var et
monopol. Det var også et monopol holdt av bokhandlerne. En bokhandler høres
greie og ufarlige ut for oss, men slik var det ikke i syttenhundretallets
England. Medlemmene i "the Conger" ble av en voksende mengde sett på som
monopolister av verste sort - et verktøy for kronens undertrykkelse, de
solgte Englands frihet mot å være garantert en monopolskinntekt. Men
monopolistene ble kvast kritisert: Milton beskrev dem som "gamle
patentholdere og monopolister i bokhandlerkunsten"; de var "menn som derfor
ikke hadde  et ærlig arbeide hvor utdanning er nødvendig."<sup>[<a name="id2690843" href="#ftn.id2690843" class="footnote">101</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Mange trodde at den makten bokhandlerne utøvde over spredning av kunnskap,
var til skade for selve spredningen, men på dette tidspunktet viste
Opplysningen viktigheten av utdannelse og kunnskap for alle. idéen om at
kunnskap burde være gratis er et kjennetegn for tiden, og disse kraftige
kommersielle interesser forstyrret denne idéen.
</p><p>
For å balansere denne makten, besluttet Parlamentet å øke konkurransen blant
bokhandlerne, og den enkleste måten å gjøre det på, var å spre mengden av
verdifulle bøker. Parlamentet begrenset derfor begrepet om opphavsrett, og
garantert slik at verdifulle bøker ville bli frie for alle utgiver å
publisere etter en begrenset periode. Slik ble det å gi eksisterende verk en
periode på tjueen år et kompromiss for å bekjempe bokhandlernes
makt. Begrensninger med dato var en indirekte måte å skape konkurranse
mellom utgivere, og slik en skapelse og spredning av kultur.
</p><p>
Når 1731 (1710+21) kom, ble bokhandlerne engstelige. De så konsekvensene av
mer konkurranse, og som alle konkurrenter, likte de det ikke. Først
ignorerte bokhandlere ganske enkelt "Statute of Anne", og fortsatte å kreve
en evigvarende rett til å kontrollere publiseringen. Men i 1735 og 1737 de
prøvde å tvinge Parlamentet til å utvide periodene. Tjueen år var ikke nok,
sa de; de trengte mer tid.
</p><p>
Parlamentet avslo kravene, Som en pamflett sa, i en vending som levere ennå
idag,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Jeg ser ingen grunn til å gi en utvidet perioden nå som ikke ville kunne gi
utvidelser om igjen og om igjen, så fort de gamle utgår; så dersom dette
lovforslaget blir vedtatt, vil effekten være: at et evig monopol blir skapt,
et stort nederlag for handelen, et angrep mot kunnskapen, ingen fordel for
forfatterne, men en stor avgift for folket; og alt dette kun for å øke
bokhandlernes personlige rikdom.<sup>[<a name="id2690921" href="#ftn.id2690921" class="footnote">102</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Etter å ha mislyktes i Parlamentet gikk utgiverne til rettssalen i en rekke
saker. Deres argument var enkelt og direkte: "Statute of Anne" ga
forfatterne en viss beskyttelse gjennom positiv loven, men denne
beskyttelsenvar ikke ment som en erstatning for felles lov. Istedet var de
ment å supplere felles lov. Ifølge sedvanerett var det galt å ta en annen
persons kreative eiendom og bruke den uten hans tillatelse. "Statute of
Anne", hevdet bokhandlere, endret ikke dette faktum. Derfor betydde ikke det
at beskyttelsen gitt av "Statute of Anne" utløp, at beskyttelsen fra
sedvaneretten utløp: Ifølge sedvaneretten hadde de rett til å fordømme
publiseringen av en bok, selv følgelig om "Statute of Anne" sa at de var
falt i det fri. Dette, mente de, var den eneste måten å beskytte
forfatterne.
</p><p>
Dette var et godt argument, og hadde støtte fra flere av den tidens ledende
jurister. Det viste også en ekstraordinær chutzpah. Inntail da, som
jusprofessor Raymond Pattetson har sagt, "var utgiverne ... like bekymret
for forfatterne som en gjeter for sine lam."<sup>[<a name="id2690988" href="#ftn.id2690988" class="footnote">103</a>]</sup> Bokselgerne brydde seg ikke det spor om forfatternes
rettigheter. Deres bekymring var den monopolske inntekten forfatterens verk
ga.
</p><p>
Men bokhandlernes argument ble ikke godtatt uten kamp. Helten fra denne
kampen var den skotske bokselgeren Alexander Donaldson.<sup>[<a name="id2691015" href="#ftn.id2691015" class="footnote">104</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Donaldson var en fremmed for Londons "the Conger". Han startet in karriere i
Edinburgh i 1750. Hans forretningsidé var billige kopier av standardverk
falt i det fri, ihvertfall fri ifølge "Statute of Anne".<sup>[<a name="id2691037" href="#ftn.id2691037" class="footnote">105</a>]</sup> Donaldsons forlag vokste og ble "et sentrum for
litterære skotter." "Blant dem," skriver professor Mark Rose, var "den unge
James Boswell som, sammen med sin venn Andrew Erskine, publiserte en hel
antologi av skotsk samtidspoesi sammen med Donaldson."<sup>[<a name="id2691056" href="#ftn.id2691056" class="footnote">106</a>]</sup> <a class="indexterm" name="id2691065"></a>
</p><p>
Da Londons bokselgere prøvde å få stengt Donaldsons butikk i Skottland, så
flyttet han butikken til London. Her solgte han billige utgaver av "de mest
populære, engelske bøker, i kamp mot sedvanerettens rett til litterær
eiendom." <sup>[<a name="id2691082" href="#ftn.id2691082" class="footnote">107</a>]</sup> Bøkene hans var mellom 30%
og 50% billigere enn "the Conger"s, og han baserte sin rett til denne
konkurransen på at bøkene, takket være "Statute of Anne", var falt i det
fri.
</p><p>
Londons bokselgere begynte straks å slå ned mot "pirater" som
Donaldson. Flere tiltak var vellykkede, den viktigste var den tidlig seieren
i kampen mellom <em class="citetitle">Millar</em> og
<em class="citetitle">Taylor</em>.
</p><p>
Millar var en bokhandler som i 1729 hadde kjøpt opp rettighetene til James
Thomsons dikt "The Seasons". Millar hadde da full beskyttelse gjennom
"Statute of Anne", men etter at denne beskyttelsen var uløpt, begynte Robert
Taylor å trykke et konkurrerende bind. Millar gikk til sak, og hevdet han
hadde en evig rett gjennom sedvaneretten, uansett hva "Statute of Anne"
sa.<sup>[<a name="id2691128" href="#ftn.id2691128" class="footnote">108</a>]</sup>
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxmansfield2"></a><p>
Til moderne juristers forbløffelse, var en av, ikke bare datidens, men en av
de største dommere i engelsk historie, Lord Mansfield, enig med
bokhandlerne. Uansett hvilken beskyttelse "Statute of Anne" gav
bokhandlerne, så sa han at den ikke fortrengte noe fra
sedvaneretten. Spørsmålet var hvorvidt sedvaneretten beskyttet forfatterne
mot pirater. Mansfield svar var ja: Sedvaneretten nektet Taylor å
reprodusere Thomsons dikt uten Millars tillatelse. Slik gav sedvaneretten
bokselgerne en evig publiseringsrett til bøker solgt til dem.
</p><p>

Ser man på det som et spørsmål innen abstrakt jus - dersom man resonnere som
om rettferdighet bare var logisk deduksjon fra de første bud - kunne
Mansfields konklusjon gitt mening. Men den overså det Parlamentet hadde
kjempet for i 1710: Hvordan man på best mulig vis kunne innskrenke
utgivernes monopolmakt. Parlamentets strategi hadde vært å kjøpe fred
gjennom å tilby en beskyttelsesperiode også for eksisterende verk, men
perioden måtte være så kort at kulturen ble utsatt for konkurranse innen
rimelig tid. Storbritannia skulle vokse fra den kontrollerte kulturen under
kronen, inn i en fri og åpen kultur.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2691195"></a><p>
Kampen for å forsvare "Statute of Anne"s begrensninger sluttet uansett ikke
der, for nå kommer Donaldson.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2691210"></a><p>
Millar døde kort tid etter sin seier. Boet hans solgte rettighetene over
Thomsons dikt til et syndikat av utgivere, deriblant Thomas
Beckett.<sup>[<a name="id2691223" href="#ftn.id2691223" class="footnote">109</a>]</sup> Da ga Donaldson ut en
uautorisert utgave av Thomsons verk. Etter avgjørelsen i
<em class="citetitle">Millar</em>-saken, gikk Beckett til sak mot
Donaldson. Donaldson tok saken inn for Overhuset, som da fungerte som en
slags høyesterett. I februar 1774 hadde dette organet muligheten til å tolke
Parlamentets mening med utøpsdatoen fra seksti år før.
</p><p>
Rettssaken <em class="citetitle">Donaldson</em> mot
<em class="citetitle">Beckett</em> fikk en enorm oppmerksomhet i hele
Storbritannia. Donaldsons advokater mente at selv om det før fantes en del
rettigheter i sedvaneretten, så var disse fortrengt av "Statute of
Anne". Etter at "Statute of Anne" var blitt vedtatt, skulle den eneste
lovlige beskyttelse for trykkerett kom derfra. Og derfor, mente de, i tråd
med vilkårene i "Statute of Anne", falle i det fri så fort
beskyttelsesperioden var over.
</p><p>
Overhuset var en merkelig institusjon. Juridiske spørsmål ble presentert for
huset, og ble først stemt over av "juslorder", medlemmer av enspesiell
rettslig gruppe som fungerte nesten slik som justiariusene i vår
Høyesterett. Deretter, etter at "juslordene" hadde stemt, stemte resten av
Overhuset.
</p><p>

Rapportene om juslordene stemmer er uenige. På enkelte punkter ser det ut
som om evigvarende beskyttelse fikk flertall. Men det er ingen tvil om
hvordan resten av Overhuset stemte. Med en majoritet på to mot en (22 mot
11) stemte de ned forslaget om en evig beskyttelse. Uansett hvordan man
hadde tolket sedvaneretten, var nå kopiretten begrenset til en periode, og
etter denne ville verket falle i det fri.
</p><p>
"Å falle i det fri". Før rettssaken <em class="citetitle">Donaldson</em> mot
<em class="citetitle">Beckett</em> var det ingen klar oppfatning om hva å falle
i det fri innebar. Før 1774 var det jo en allmenn oppfatning om at
kopiretten var evigvarende. Men etter 1774 ble Public Domain født.For første
gang i angloamerikansk historie var den lovlige beskyttelsen av et verk
utgått, og de største verk i engelsk historie - inkludert Shakespeare,
Bacon, Milton, Johnson og Bunyan - var frie.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2691320"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2691326"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2691332"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2691339"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2691345"></a>
</p><p>
Vi kan knapt forestille oss det, men denne avgjørelsen fra Overhuset fyrte
opp under en svært populær og politisk reaksjon. I Skottland, hvor de fleste
piratugiverne hadde holdt til, ble avgjørelsen feiret i gatene. Som
<em class="citetitle">Edinburgh Advertiser</em> skrev "Ingen privatsak har noen
gang fått slik oppmerksomhet fra folket, og ingen sak som har blitt prøvet i
Overhuset har interessert så mange enkeltmennesker." "Stor glede i Edinburgh
etter seieren over litterær eiendom: bål og *illuminations*.<sup>[<a name="id2691374" href="#ftn.id2691374" class="footnote">110</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
I London, ihvertfall blant utgiverne, var reaksjonen like sterk, men i
motsatt retning. <em class="citetitle">Morning Chronicle</em> skrev:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Gjennom denne avgjørelsen ... er verdier til nesten 200 000 pund, som er
blitt ærlig kjøpt gjennom allment salg, og som i går var eiendom, er nå
redusert til ingenting. Bokselgerne i London og Westminster, mange av dem
har solgt hus og eiendom for å kjøpe kopirettigheter, er med ett ruinerte,
og mange som gjennom mange år har opparbeidet kompetanse for å brødfø
familien, sitter nå uten en shilling til sine.<sup>[<a name="id2691404" href="#ftn.id2691404" class="footnote">111</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>


Ruinert er en overdrivelse. Men det er ingen overdrivelse å si at endringen
var stor. Vedtaket fra Overhuset betydde at bokhandlerne ikke lenger kunnen
kontrollere hvordan kulturen i England ville vokse og utvikle seg. Kulturen
i England var etter dette <span class="emphasis"><em>fri</em></span>. Ikke i den betydning at
kopiretten ble ignorert, for utgiverne hadde i en begrenset periode rett
over trykkingen. Og heller ikke i den betydningen at bøker kunne stjeles,
for selv etter at boken var falt i det fri, så måtte den kjøpes. Men
<span class="emphasis"><em>fri</em></span> i betydningen at kulturen og dens vekst ikke lenger
var kontrollert av en liten gruppe utgivere. Som alle frie markeder, ville
dette markedet vokse og utvikle seg etter tilbud og etterspørsel. Den
engelske kulturen ble nå formet slik flertallet Englands lesere ville at det
skulle formes - gjennom valget av hva de kjøpte og skrev, gjennom valget av
*memes* de gjentok og beundret. Valg i en <span class="emphasis"><em>konkurrerende
sammenheng</em></span>, ikke der hvor valgene var om hvilken kultur som
skulle være tilgjengelig for folket og hvor deres tilgang til den ble styrt
av noen få, på tros av flertallets ønsker.
</p><p>
Til sist, dette var en verden hvor Parlamentet var antimonopolistisk, og
holdt stand mot utgivernes krav. I en verden hvor parlamentet er lett å
påvirke, vil den frie kultur være mindre beskyttet.

Jon Else is a filmmaker. He is best known for his documentaries and has been
very successful in spreading his art. He is also a teacher, and as a teacher
myself, I envy the loyalty and admiration that his students feel for him. (I
met, by accident, two of his students at a dinner party.  He was their god.)
</p><p>
Else worked on a documentary that I was involved in. At a break, he told me
a story about the freedom to create with film in America today.
</p><p>
In 1990, Else was working on a documentary about Wagner's Ring Cycle. The
focus was stagehands at the San Francisco Opera.  Stagehands are a
particularly funny and colorful element of an opera.  During a show, they
hang out below the stage in the grips' lounge and in the lighting loft. They
make a perfect contrast to the art on the stage.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2691507"></a>
</p><p>

During one of the performances, Else was shooting some stagehands playing
checkers. In one corner of the room was a television set.  Playing on the
television set, while the stagehands played checkers and the opera company
played Wagner, was <em class="citetitle">The Simpsons</em>. As Else judged it,
this touch of cartoon helped capture the flavor of what was special about
the scene.
</p><p>
Years later, when he finally got funding to complete the film, Else
attempted to clear the rights for those few seconds of <em class="citetitle">The
Simpsons</em>.  For of course, those few seconds are copyrighted; and
of course, to use copyrighted material you need the permission of the
copyright owner, unless "fair use" or some other privilege applies.
</p><p>
Else called <em class="citetitle">Simpsons</em> creator Matt Groening's office
to get permission.  Groening approved the shot. The shot was a
four-and-a-halfsecond image on a tiny television set in the corner of the
room. How could it hurt? Groening was happy to have it in the film, but he
told Else to contact Gracie Films, the company that produces the program.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2691551"></a>
</p><p>
Gracie Films was okay with it, too, but they, like Groening, wanted to be
careful. So they told Else to contact Fox, Gracie's parent company.  Else
called Fox and told them about the clip in the corner of the one room shot
of the film. Matt Groening had already given permission, Else said. He was
just confirming the permission with Fox.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2691567"></a>
</p><p>
Then, as Else told me, "two things happened. First we discovered . . . that
Matt Groening doesn't own his own creation&#8212;or at least that someone
[at Fox] believes he doesn't own his own creation." And second, Fox "wanted
ten thousand dollars as a licensing fee for us to use this four-point-five
seconds of . . . entirely unsolicited <em class="citetitle">Simpsons</em> which
was in the corner of the shot."
</p><p>
Else was certain there was a mistake. He worked his way up to someone he
thought was a vice president for licensing, Rebecca Herrera.  He explained
to her, "There must be some mistake here. . . .  We're asking for your
educational rate on this." That was the educational rate, Herrera told
Else. A day or so later, Else called again to confirm what he had been told.
</p><p>

"I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight," he told me. "Yes, you have
your facts straight," she said. It would cost $10,000 to use the clip of
<em class="citetitle">The Simpsons</em> in the corner of a shot in a documentary
film about Wagner's Ring Cycle. And then, astonishingly, Herrera told Else,
"And if you quote me, I'll turn you over to our attorneys." As an assistant
to Herrera told Else later on, "They don't give a shit. They just want the
money."
</p><p>
Else didn't have the money to buy the right to replay what was playing on
the television backstage at the San Francisco Opera. To reproduce this
reality was beyond the documentary filmmaker's budget. At the very last
minute before the film was to be released, Else digitally replaced the shot
with a clip from another film that he had worked on, <em class="citetitle">The Day
After Trinity</em>, from ten years before.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2691624"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2691630"></a>
</p><p>
There's no doubt that someone, whether Matt Groening or Fox, owns the
copyright to <em class="citetitle">The Simpsons</em>. That copyright is their
property.  To use that copyrighted material thus sometimes requires the
permission of the copyright owner. If the use that Else wanted to make of
the <em class="citetitle">Simpsons</em> copyright were one of the uses
restricted by the law, then he would need to get the permission of the
copyright owner before he could use the work in that way. And in a free
market, it is the owner of the copyright who gets to set the price for any
use that the law says the owner gets to control.
</p><p>
For example, "public performance" is a use of <em class="citetitle">The
Simpsons</em> that the copyright owner gets to control. If you take a
selection of favorite episodes, rent a movie theater, and charge for tickets
to come see "My Favorite <em class="citetitle">Simpsons</em>," then you need to
get permission from the copyright owner. And the copyright owner (rightly,
in my view) can charge whatever she wants&#8212;$10 or $1,000,000. That's
her right, as set by the law.
</p><p>
But when lawyers hear this story about Jon Else and Fox, their first thought
is "fair use."<sup>[<a name="id2691677" href="#ftn.id2691677" class="footnote">112</a>]</sup> Else's use of just 4.5
seconds of an indirect shot of a <em class="citetitle">Simpsons</em> episode is
clearly a fair use of <em class="citetitle">The Simpsons</em>&#8212;and fair use
does not require the permission of anyone.
</p><p>


So I asked Else why he didn't just rely upon "fair use." Here's his reply:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The <em class="citetitle">Simpsons</em> fiasco was for me a great lesson in the
gulf between what lawyers find irrelevant in some abstract sense, and what
is crushingly relevant in practice to those of us actually trying to make
and broadcast documentaries. I never had any doubt that it was "clearly fair
use" in an absolute legal sense. But I couldn't rely on the concept in any
concrete way. Here's why:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>


Before our films can be broadcast, the network requires that we buy Errors
and Omissions insurance. The carriers require a detailed "visual cue sheet"
listing the source and licensing status of each shot in the film. They take
a dim view of "fair use," and a claim of "fair use" can grind the
application process to a halt.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

I probably never should have asked Matt Groening in the first place. But I
knew (at least from folklore) that Fox had a history of tracking down and
stopping unlicensed <em class="citetitle">Simpsons</em> usage, just as George
Lucas had a very high profile litigating <em class="citetitle">Star Wars</em>
usage. So I decided to play by the book, thinking that we would be granted
free or cheap license to four seconds of <em class="citetitle">Simpsons</em>. As
a documentary producer working to exhaustion on a shoestring, the last thing
I wanted was to risk legal trouble, even nuisance legal trouble, and even to
defend a principle.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2691772"></a>
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>



I did, in fact, speak with one of your colleagues at Stanford Law School
. . . who confirmed that it was fair use. He also confirmed that Fox would
"depose and litigate you to within an inch of your life," regardless of the
merits of my claim. He made clear that it would boil down to who had the
bigger legal department and the deeper pockets, me or them.

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>


The question of fair use usually comes up at the end of the project, when we
are up against a release deadline and out of money.
</p></li></ol></div></blockquote></div><p>
In theory, fair use means you need no permission. The theory therefore
supports free culture and insulates against a permission culture.  But in
practice, fair use functions very differently. The fuzzy lines of the law,
tied to the extraordinary liability if lines are crossed, means that the
effective fair use for many types of creators is slight. The law has the
right aim; practice has defeated the aim.
</p><p>
This practice shows just how far the law has come from its
eighteenth-century roots. The law was born as a shield to protect
publishers' profits against the unfair competition of a pirate. It has
matured into a sword that interferes with any use, transformative or not.

In 1993, Alex Alben was a lawyer working at Starwave, Inc.  Starwave was an
innovative company founded by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen to develop
digital entertainment. Long before the Internet became popular, Starwave
began investing in new technology for delivering entertainment in
anticipation of the power of networks.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2691858"></a><p>
Alben had a special interest in new technology. He was intrigued by the
emerging market for CD-ROM technology&#8212;not to distribute film, but to
do things with film that otherwise would be very difficult.  In 1993, he
launched an initiative to develop a product to build retrospectives on the
work of particular actors. The first actor chosen was Clint Eastwood. The
idea was to showcase all of the work of Eastwood, with clips from his films
and interviews with figures important to his career.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2691866"></a><p>
At that time, Eastwood had made more than fifty films, as an actor and as a
director. Alben began with a series of interviews with Eastwood, asking him
about his career. Because Starwave produced those interviews, it was free to
include them on the CD.
</p><p>


That alone would not have made a very interesting product, so Starwave
wanted to add content from the movies in Eastwood's career: posters,
scripts, and other material relating to the films Eastwood made. Most of his
career was spent at Warner Brothers, and so it was relatively easy to get
permission for that content.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2691900"></a><p>
Then Alben and his team decided to include actual film clips. "Our goal was
that we were going to have a clip from every one of Eastwood's films," Alben
told me. It was here that the problem arose. "No one had ever really done
this before," Alben explained. "No one had ever tried to do this in the
context of an artistic look at an actor's career."
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2691916"></a><p>
Alben brought the idea to Michael Slade, the CEO of Starwave.  Slade asked,
"Well, what will it take?"
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2691927"></a><p>
Alben replied, "Well, we're going to have to clear rights from everyone who
appears in these films, and the music and everything else that we want to
use in these film clips." Slade said, "Great! Go for it."<sup>[<a name="id2691939" href="#ftn.id2691939" class="footnote">113</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
The problem was that neither Alben nor Slade had any idea what clearing
those rights would mean. Every actor in each of the films could have a claim
to royalties for the reuse of that film. But CD- ROMs had not been specified
in the contracts for the actors, so there was no clear way to know just what
Starwave was to do.
</p><p>
I asked Alben how he dealt with the problem. With an obvious pride in his
resourcefulness that obscured the obvious bizarreness of his tale, Alben
recounted just what they did:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So we very mechanically went about looking up the film clips.  We made some
artistic decisions about what film clips to include&#8212;of course we were
going to use the "Make my day" clip from <em class="citetitle">Dirty
Harry</em>. But you then need to get the guy on the ground who's
wiggling under the gun and you need to get his permission.  And then you
have to decide what you are going to pay him.
</p><p>


We decided that it would be fair if we offered them the dayplayer rate for
the right to reuse that performance. We're talking about a clip of less than
a minute, but to reuse that performance in the CD-ROM the rate at the time
was about $600.  So we had to identify the people&#8212;some of them were
hard to identify because in Eastwood movies you can't tell who's the guy
crashing through the glass&#8212;is it the actor or is it the stuntman? And
then we just, we put together a team, my assistant and some others, and we
just started calling people.
</p></blockquote></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2692000"></a><p>
Some actors were glad to help&#8212;Donald Sutherland, for example, followed
up himself to be sure that the rights had been cleared.  Others were
dumbfounded at their good fortune. Alben would ask, "Hey, can I pay you $600
or maybe if you were in two films, you know, $1,200?" And they would say,
"Are you for real? Hey, I'd love to get $1,200." And some of course were a
bit difficult (estranged ex-wives, in particular). But eventually, Alben and
his team had cleared the rights to this retrospective CD-ROM on Clint
Eastwood's career.
</p><p>
It was one <span class="emphasis"><em>year</em></span> later&#8212;"and even then we weren't
sure whether we were totally in the clear."
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2692037"></a><p>
Alben is proud of his work. The project was the first of its kind and the
only time he knew of that a team had undertaken such a massive project for
the purpose of releasing a retrospective.
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Everyone thought it would be too hard. Everyone just threw up their hands
and said, "Oh, my gosh, a film, it's so many copyrights, there's the music,
there's the screenplay, there's the director, there's the actors." But we
just broke it down. We just put it into its constituent parts and said,
"Okay, there's this many actors, this many directors, . . . this many
musicians," and we just went at it very systematically and cleared the
rights.
</p></blockquote></div><p>



And no doubt, the product itself was exceptionally good. Eastwood loved it,
and it sold very well.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2692071"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2692077"></a><p>
But I pressed Alben about how weird it seems that it would have to take a
year's work simply to clear rights. No doubt Alben had done this
efficiently, but as Peter Drucker has famously quipped, "There is nothing so
useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at
all."<sup>[<a name="id2692091" href="#ftn.id2692091" class="footnote">114</a>]</sup> Did it make sense, I asked Alben,
that this is the way a new work has to be made?
</p><p>
For, as he acknowledged, "very few . . . have the time and resources, and
the will to do this," and thus, very few such works would ever be made. Does
it make sense, I asked him, from the standpoint of what anybody really
thought they were ever giving rights for originally, that you would have to
go clear rights for these kinds of clips?
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I don't think so. When an actor renders a performance in a movie, he or she
gets paid very well. . . . And then when 30 seconds of that performance is
used in a new product that is a retrospective of somebody's career, I don't
think that that person . . . should be compensated for that.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Or at least, is this <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> the artist should be
compensated? Would it make sense, I asked, for there to be some kind of
statutory license that someone could pay and be free to make derivative use
of clips like this? Did it really make sense that a follow-on creator would
have to track down every artist, actor, director, musician, and get explicit
permission from each? Wouldn't a lot more be created if the legal part of
the creative process could be made to be more clean?
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

Absolutely. I think that if there were some fair-licensing
mechanism&#8212;where you weren't subject to hold-ups and you weren't
subject to estranged former spouses&#8212;you'd see a lot more of this work,
because it wouldn't be so daunting to try to put together a retrospective of
someone's career and meaningfully illustrate it with lots of media from that
person's career. You'd build in a cost as the producer of one of these
things. You'd build in a cost of paying X dollars to the talent that
performed. But it would be a known cost. That's the thing that trips
everybody up and makes this kind of product hard to get off the ground. If
you knew I have a hundred minutes of film in this product and it's going to
cost me X, then you build your budget around it, and you can get investments
and everything else that you need to produce it. But if you say, "Oh, I want
a hundred minutes of something and I have no idea what it's going to cost
me, and a certain number of people are going to hold me up for money," then
it becomes difficult to put one of these things together.
</p></blockquote></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2692172"></a><p>
Alben worked for a big company. His company was backed by some of the
richest investors in the world. He therefore had authority and access that
the average Web designer would not have. So if it took him a year, how long
would it take someone else? And how much creativity is never made just
because the costs of clearing the rights are so high? These costs are the
burdens of a kind of regulation. Put on a Republican hat for a moment, and
get angry for a bit. The government defines the scope of these rights, and
the scope defined determines how much it's going to cost to negotiate
them. (Remember the idea that land runs to the heavens, and imagine the
pilot purchasing flythrough rights as he negotiates to fly from Los Angeles
to San Francisco.)  These rights might well have once made sense; but as
circumstances change, they make no sense at all. Or at least, a
well-trained, regulationminimizing Republican should look at the rights and
ask, "Does this still make sense?"
</p><p>

I've seen the flash of recognition when people get this point, but only a
few times. The first was at a conference of federal judges in California.
The judges were gathered to discuss the emerging topic of cyber-law. I was
asked to be on the panel. Harvey Saferstein, a well-respected lawyer from an
L.A. firm, introduced the panel with a video that he and a friend, Robert
Fairbank, had produced.
</p><p>
Videoen var en glimrende sammenstilling av filmer fra hver periode i det
tjuende århundret, rammet inn rundt idéen om en episode i TV-serien
<em class="citetitle">60 Minutes</em>. Utførelsen var perfekt, ned til seksti
minutter stoppeklokken. Dommerne elsket enhver minutt av den.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2692241"></a><p>
Da lysene kom på, kikket jeg over til min medpaneldeltager, David Nimmer,
kanskje den ledende opphavsrettakademiker og utøver i nasjonen. Han hadde en
forbauset uttrykk i ansiktet sitt, mens han tittet ut over rommet med over
250 godt underholdte dommere. Med en en illevarslende tone, begynte han sin
tale med et spørsmål: "Vet dere hvor mange føderale lover som nettopp brutt
i dette rommet?"
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2692261"></a><p>
For of course, the two brilliantly talented creators who made this film
hadn't done what Alben did. They hadn't spent a year clearing the rights to
these clips; technically, what they had done violated the law.  Of course,
it wasn't as if they or anyone were going to be prosecuted for this
violation (the presence of 250 judges and a gaggle of federal marshals
notwithstanding). But Nimmer was making an important point: A year before
anyone would have heard of the word Napster, and two years before another
member of our panel, David Boies, would defend Napster before the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals, Nimmer was trying to get the judges to see that
the law would not be friendly to the capacities that this technology would
enable. Technology means you can now do amazing things easily; but you
couldn't easily do them legally.
</p><p>
We live in a "cut and paste" culture enabled by technology. Anyone building
a presentation knows the extraordinary freedom that the cut and paste
architecture of the Internet created&#8212;in a second you can find just
about any image you want; in another second, you can have it planted in your
presentation.
</p><p>
But presentations are just a tiny beginning. Using the Internet and its
archives, musicians are able to string together mixes of sound never before
imagined; filmmakers are able to build movies out of clips on computers
around the world. An extraordinary site in Sweden takes images of
politicians and blends them with music to create biting political
commentary. A site called Camp Chaos has produced some of the most biting
criticism of the record industry that there is through the mixing of Flash!
and music.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2692289"></a>
</p><p>
All of these creations are technically illegal. Even if the creators wanted
to be "legal," the cost of complying with the law is impossibly
high. Therefore, for the law-abiding sorts, a wealth of creativity is never
made. And for that part that is made, if it doesn't follow the clearance
rules, it doesn't get released.
</p><p>
To some, these stories suggest a solution: Let's alter the mix of rights so
that people are free to build upon our culture. Free to add or mix as they
see fit. We could even make this change without necessarily requiring that
the "free" use be free as in "free beer." Instead, the system could simply
make it easy for follow-on creators to compensate artists without requiring
an army of lawyers to come along: a rule, for example, that says "the
royalty owed the copyright owner of an unregistered work for the derivative
reuse of his work will be a flat 1 percent of net revenues, to be held in
escrow for the copyright owner." Under this rule, the copyright owner could
benefit from some royalty, but he would not have the benefit of a full
property right (meaning the right to name his own price) unless he registers
the work.
</p><p>
Who could possibly object to this? And what reason would there be for
objecting? We're talking about work that is not now being made; which if
made, under this plan, would produce new income for artists.  What reason
would anyone have to oppose it?
</p><p>

In February 2003, DreamWorks studios announced an agreement with Mike Myers,
the comic genius of <em class="citetitle">Saturday Night Live</em> and Austin
Powers. According to the announcement, Myers and Dream-Works would work
together to form a "unique filmmaking pact." Under the agreement, DreamWorks
"will acquire the rights to existing motion picture hits and classics, write
new storylines and&#8212;with the use of stateof-the-art digital
technology&#8212;insert Myers and other actors into the film, thereby
creating an entirely new piece of entertainment."
</p><p>
The announcement called this "film sampling." As Myers explained, "Film
Sampling is an exciting way to put an original spin on existing films and
allow audiences to see old movies in a new light. Rap artists have been
doing this for years with music and now we are able to take that same
concept and apply it to film." Steven Spielberg is quoted as saying, "If
anyone can create a way to bring old films to new audiences, it is Mike."
</p><p>
Spielberg is right. Film sampling by Myers will be brilliant. But if you
don't think about it, you might miss the truly astonishing point about this
announcement. As the vast majority of our film heritage remains under
copyright, the real meaning of the DreamWorks announcement is just this: It
is Mike Myers and only Mike Myers who is free to sample. Any general freedom
to build upon the film archive of our culture, a freedom in other contexts
presumed for us all, is now a privilege reserved for the funny and
famous&#8212;and presumably rich.
</p><p>
This privilege becomes reserved for two sorts of reasons. The first
continues the story of the last chapter: the vagueness of "fair use." Much
of "sampling" should be considered "fair use." But few would rely upon so
weak a doctrine to create. That leads to the second reason that the
privilege is reserved for the few: The costs of negotiating the legal rights
for the creative reuse of content are astronomically high.  These costs
mirror the costs with fair use: You either pay a lawyer to defend your fair
use rights or pay a lawyer to track down permissions so you don't have to
rely upon fair use rights. Either way, the creative process is a process of
paying lawyers&#8212;again a privilege, or perhaps a curse, reserved for the
few.

Technically, the rights that Alben had to clear were mainly those of
publicity&#8212;rights an artist has to control the commercial exploitation
of his image.  But these rights, too, burden "Rip, Mix, Burn" creativity, as
this chapter evinces.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2691868"></a>

In April 1996, millions of "bots"&#8212;computer codes designed to "spider,"
or automatically search the Internet and copy content&#8212;began running
across the Net. Page by page, these bots copied Internet-based information
onto a small set of computers located in a basement in San Francisco's
Presidio. Once the bots finished the whole of the Internet, they started
again. Over and over again, once every two months, these bits of code took
copies of the Internet and stored them.
</p><p>
By October 2001, the bots had collected more than five years of copies. And
at a small announcement in Berkeley, California, the archive that these
copies created, the Internet Archive, was opened to the world. Using a
technology called "the Way Back Machine," you could enter a Web page, and
see all of its copies going back to 1996, as well as when those pages
changed.
</p><p>
This is the thing about the Internet that Orwell would have appreciated.  In
the dystopia described in <em class="citetitle">1984</em>, old newspapers were
constantly updated to assure that the current view of the world, approved of
by the government, was not contradicted by previous news reports.
</p><p>


Thousands of workers constantly reedited the past, meaning there was no way
ever to know whether the story you were reading today was the story that was
printed on the date published on the paper.
</p><p>
It's the same with the Internet. If you go to a Web page today, there's no
way for you to know whether the content you are reading is the same as the
content you read before. The page may seem the same, but the content could
easily be different. The Internet is Orwell's library&#8212;constantly
updated, without any reliable memory.
</p><p>
Until the Way Back Machine, at least. With the Way Back Machine, and the
Internet Archive underlying it, you can see what the Internet was. You have
the power to see what you remember. More importantly, perhaps, you also have
the power to find what you don't remember and what others might prefer you
forget.<sup>[<a name="id2692469" href="#ftn.id2692469" class="footnote">115</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
We take it for granted that we can go back to see what we remember
reading. Think about newspapers. If you wanted to study the reaction of your
hometown newspaper to the race riots in Watts in 1965, or to Bull Connor's
water cannon in 1963, you could go to your public library and look at the
newspapers. Those papers probably exist on microfiche. If you're lucky, they
exist in paper, too. Either way, you are free, using a library, to go back
and remember&#8212;not just what it is convenient to remember, but remember
something close to the truth.
</p><p>
It is said that those who fail to remember history are doomed to repeat
it. That's not quite correct. We <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> forget
history. The key is whether we have a way to go back to rediscover what we
forget. More directly, the key is whether an objective past can keep us
honest. Libraries help do that, by collecting content and keeping it, for
schoolchildren, for researchers, for grandma. A free society presumes this
knowedge.
</p><p>

The Internet was an exception to this presumption. Until the Internet
Archive, there was no way to go back. The Internet was the quintessentially
transitory medium. And yet, as it becomes more important in forming and
reforming society, it becomes more and more important to maintain in some
historical form. It's just bizarre to think that we have scads of archives
of newspapers from tiny towns around the world, yet there is but one copy of
the Internet&#8212;the one kept by the Internet Archive.
</p><p>
Brewster Kahle is the founder of the Internet Archive. He was a very
successful Internet entrepreneur after he was a successful computer
researcher.  In the 1990s, Kahle decided he had had enough business
success.  It was time to become a different kind of success. So he launched
a series of projects designed to archive human knowledge. The Internet
Archive was just the first of the projects of this Andrew Carnegie of the
Internet. By December of 2002, the archive had over 10 billion pages, and it
was growing at about a billion pages a month.
</p><p>
The Way Back Machine is the largest archive of human knowledge in human
history. At the end of 2002, it held "two hundred and thirty terabytes of
material"&#8212;and was "ten times larger than the Library of Congress." And
this was just the first of the archives that Kahle set out to build. In
addition to the Internet Archive, Kahle has been constructing the Television
Archive. Television, it turns out, is even more ephemeral than the
Internet. While much of twentieth-century culture was constructed through
television, only a tiny proportion of that culture is available for anyone
to see today. Three hours of news are recorded each evening by Vanderbilt
University&#8212;thanks to a specific exemption in the copyright law. That
content is indexed, and is available to scholars for a very low fee. "But
other than that, [television] is almost unavailable," Kahle told me. "If you
were Barbara Walters you could get access to [the archives], but if you are
just a graduate student?" As Kahle put it,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

Do you remember when Dan Quayle was interacting with Murphy Brown? Remember
that back and forth surreal experience of a politician interacting with a
fictional television character? If you were a graduate student wanting to
study that, and you wanted to get those original back and forth exchanges
between the two, the <em class="citetitle">60 Minutes</em> episode that came out
after it . . . it would be almost impossible. . . . Those materials are
almost unfindable. . . .
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Why is that? Why is it that the part of our culture that is recorded in
newspapers remains perpetually accessible, while the part that is recorded
on videotape is not? How is it that we've created a world where researchers
trying to understand the effect of media on nineteenthcentury America will
have an easier time than researchers trying to understand the effect of
media on twentieth-century America?
</p><p>
In part, this is because of the law. Early in American copyright law,
copyright owners were required to deposit copies of their work in
libraries.  These copies were intended both to facilitate the spread of
knowledge and to assure that a copy of the work would be around once the
copyright expired, so that others might access and copy the work.
</p><p>
These rules applied to film as well. But in 1915, the Library of Congress
made an exception for film. Film could be copyrighted so long as such
deposits were made. But the filmmaker was then allowed to borrow back the
deposits&#8212;for an unlimited time at no cost. In 1915 alone, there were
more than 5,475 films deposited and "borrowed back." Thus, when the
copyrights to films expire, there is no copy held by any library. The copy
exists&#8212;if it exists at all&#8212;in the library archive of the film
company.<sup>[<a name="id2692533" href="#ftn.id2692533" class="footnote">116</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
The same is generally true about television. Television broadcasts were
originally not copyrighted&#8212;there was no way to capture the broadcasts,
so there was no fear of "theft." But as technology enabled capturing,
broadcasters relied increasingly upon the law. The law required they make a
copy of each broadcast for the work to be "copyrighted." But those copies
were simply kept by the broadcasters. No library had any right to them; the
government didn't demand them.  The content of this part of American culture
is practically invisible to anyone who would look.
</p><p>

Kahle was eager to correct this. Before September 11, 2001, he and his
allies had started capturing television. They selected twenty stations from
around the world and hit the Record button. After September 11, Kahle,
working with dozens of others, selected twenty stations from around the
world and, beginning October 11, 2001, made their coverage during the week
of September 11 available free on-line.  Anyone could see how news reports
from around the world covered the events of that day.
</p><p>
Kahle had the same idea with film. Working with Rick Prelinger, whose
archive of film includes close to 45,000 "ephemeral films" (meaning films
other than Hollywood movies, films that were never copyrighted), Kahle
established the Movie Archive. Prelinger let Kahle digitize 1,300 films in
this archive and post those films on the Internet to be downloaded for
free. Prelinger's is a for-profit company. It sells copies of these films as
stock footage. What he has discovered is that after he made a significant
chunk available for free, his stock footage sales went up
dramatically. People could easily find the material they wanted to use. Some
downloaded that material and made films on their own. Others purchased
copies to enable other films to be made.  Either way, the archive enabled
access to this important part of our culture.  Want to see a copy of the
"Duck and Cover" film that instructed children how to save themselves in the
middle of nuclear attack? Go to archive.org, and you can download the film
in a few minutes&#8212;for free.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2692650"></a>
</p><p>
Here again, Kahle is providing access to a part of our culture that we
otherwise could not get easily, if at all. It is yet another part of what
defines the twentieth century that we have lost to history. The law doesn't
require these copies to be kept by anyone, or to be deposited in an archive
by anyone. Therefore, there is no simple way to find them.
</p><p>
The key here is access, not price. Kahle wants to enable free access to this
content, but he also wants to enable others to sell access to it. His aim is
to ensure competition in access to this important part of our culture.  Not
during the commercial life of a bit of creative property, but during a
second life that all creative property has&#8212;a noncommercial life.
</p><p>

For here is an idea that we should more clearly recognize. Every bit of
creative property goes through different "lives." In its first life, if the
creator is lucky, the content is sold. In such cases the commercial market
is successful for the creator. The vast majority of creative property
doesn't enjoy such success, but some clearly does. For that content,
commercial life is extremely important. Without this commercial market,
there would be, many argue, much less creativity.
</p><p>
After the commercial life of creative property has ended, our tradition has
always supported a second life as well. A newspaper delivers the news every
day to the doorsteps of America. The very next day, it is used to wrap fish
or to fill boxes with fragile gifts or to build an archive of knowledge
about our history. In this second life, the content can continue to inform
even if that information is no longer sold.
</p><p>
The same has always been true about books. A book goes out of print very
quickly (the average today is after about a year<sup>[<a name="id2692749" href="#ftn.id2692749" class="footnote">117</a>]</sup>). After it is out of print, it can be sold in used book stores
without the copyright owner getting anything and stored in libraries, where
many get to read the book, also for free. Used book stores and libraries are
thus the second life of a book. That second life is extremely important to
the spread and stability of culture.
</p><p>
Yet increasingly, any assumption about a stable second life for creative
property does not hold true with the most important components of popular
culture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. For
these&#8212;television, movies, music, radio, the Internet&#8212;there is no
guarantee of a second life. For these sorts of culture, it is as if we've
replaced libraries with Barnes &amp; Noble superstores. With this culture,
what's accessible is nothing but what a certain limited market demands.
Beyond that, culture disappears.
</p><p>

For most of the twentieth century, it was economics that made this so. It
would have been insanely expensive to collect and make accessible all
television and film and music: The cost of analog copies is extraordinarily
high. So even though the law in principle would have restricted the ability
of a Brewster Kahle to copy culture generally, the real restriction was
economics. The market made it impossibly difficult to do anything about this
ephemeral culture; the law had little practical effect.
</p><p>
Perhaps the single most important feature of the digital revolution is that
for the first time since the Library of Alexandria, it is feasible to
imagine constructing archives that hold all culture produced or distributed
publicly. Technology makes it possible to imagine an archive of all books
published, and increasingly makes it possible to imagine an archive of all
moving images and sound.
</p><p>
The scale of this potential archive is something we've never imagined
before. The Brewster Kahles of our history have dreamed about it; but we are
for the first time at a point where that dream is possible. As Kahle
describes,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It looks like there's about two to three million recordings of music.
Ever. There are about a hundred thousand theatrical releases of movies,
. . . and about one to two million movies [distributed] during the twentieth
century. There are about twenty-six million different titles of books. All
of these would fit on computers that would fit in this room and be able to
be afforded by a small company.  So we're at a turning point in our
history. Universal access is the goal. And the opportunity of leading a

Kahle is not the only librarian. The Internet Archive is not the only
archive. But Kahle and the Internet Archive suggest what the future of
libraries or archives could be. <span class="emphasis"><em>When</em></span> the commercial
life of creative property ends, I don't know. But it does. And whenever it
does, Kahle and his archive hint at a world where this knowledge, and
culture, remains perpetually available. Some will draw upon it to understand
it; some to criticize it. Some will use it, as Walt Disney did, to re-create
the past for the future. These technologies promise something that had
become unimaginable for much of our past&#8212;a future
<span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> our past. The technology of digital arts could make
the dream of the Library of Alexandria real again.
</p><p>
Technologists have thus removed the economic costs of building such an
archive. But lawyers' costs remain. For as much as we might like to call
these "archives," as warm as the idea of a "library" might seem, the
"content" that is collected in these digital spaces is also someone's
"property." And the law of property restricts the freedoms that Kahle and
others would exercise.

Jack Valenti has been the president of the Motion Picture Association of
America since 1966. He first came to Washington, D.C., with Lyndon Johnson's
administration&#8212;literally. The famous picture of Johnson's swearing-in
on Air Force One after the assassination of President Kennedy has Valenti in
the background. In his almost forty years of running the MPAA, Valenti has
established himself as perhaps the most prominent and effective lobbyist in
Washington.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2692858"></a>
</p><p>
The MPAA is the American branch of the international Motion Picture
Association. It was formed in 1922 as a trade association whose goal was to
defend American movies against increasing domestic criticism.  The
organization now represents not only filmmakers but producers and
distributors of entertainment for television, video, and cable. Its board is
made up of the chairmen and presidents of the seven major producers and
distributors of motion picture and television programs in the United States:
Walt Disney, Sony Pictures Entertainment, MGM, Paramount Pictures, Twentieth
Century Fox, Universal Studios, and Warner Brothers.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2692916"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2692921"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2692928"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2692934"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2692940"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2692946"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2692953"></a>
</p><p>


Valenti is only the third president of the MPAA. No president before him has
had as much influence over that organization, or over Washington. As a
Texan, Valenti has mastered the single most important political skill of a
Southerner&#8212;the ability to appear simple and slow while hiding a
lightning-fast intellect. To this day, Valenti plays the simple, humble
man. But this Harvard MBA, and author of four books, who finished high
school at the age of fifteen and flew more than fifty combat missions in
World War II, is no Mr. Smith. When Valenti went to Washington, he mastered
the city in a quintessentially Washingtonian way.
</p><p>
In defending artistic liberty and the freedom of speech that our culture
depends upon, the MPAA has done important good. In crafting the MPAA rating
system, it has probably avoided a great deal of speech-regulating harm. But
there is an aspect to the organization's mission that is both the most
radical and the most important. This is the organization's effort,
epitomized in Valenti's every act, to redefine the meaning of "creative
property."
</p><p>
In 1982, Valenti's testimony to Congress captured the strategy perfectly:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
No matter the lengthy arguments made, no matter the charges and the
counter-charges, no matter the tumult and the shouting, reasonable men and
women will keep returning to the fundamental issue, the central theme which
animates this entire debate: <span class="emphasis"><em>Creative property owners must be
accorded the same rights and protection resident in all other property
owners in the nation</em></span>. That is the issue.  That is the
question. And that is the rostrum on which this entire hearing and the
debates to follow must rest.<sup>[<a name="id2693009" href="#ftn.id2693009" class="footnote">118</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>

The strategy of this rhetoric, like the strategy of most of Valenti's
rhetoric, is brilliant and simple and brilliant because simple. The "central
theme" to which "reasonable men and women" will return is this: "Creative
property owners must be accorded the same rights and protections resident in
all other property owners in the nation." There are no second-class
citizens, Valenti might have continued. There should be no second-class
property owners.
</p><p>
This claim has an obvious and powerful intuitive pull. It is stated with
such clarity as to make the idea as obvious as the notion that we use
elections to pick presidents. But in fact, there is no more extreme a claim
made by <span class="emphasis"><em>anyone</em></span> who is serious in this debate than this
claim of Valenti's. Jack Valenti, however sweet and however brilliant, is
perhaps the nation's foremost extremist when it comes to the nature and
scope of "creative property." His views have <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span>
reasonable connection to our actual legal tradition, even if the subtle pull
of his Texan charm has slowly redefined that tradition, at least in
Washington.
</p><p>
While "creative property" is certainly "property" in a nerdy and precise
sense that lawyers are trained to understand,<sup>[<a name="id2693061" href="#ftn.id2693061" class="footnote">119</a>]</sup> it has never been the case, nor should it be, that "creative
property owners" have been "accorded the same rights and protection resident
in all other property owners." Indeed, if creative property owners were
given the same rights as all other property owners, that would effect a
radical, and radically undesirable, change in our tradition.
</p><p>
Valenti knows this. But he speaks for an industry that cares squat for our
tradition and the values it represents. He speaks for an industry that is
instead fighting to restore the tradition that the British overturned in
1710. In the world that Valenti's changes would create, a powerful few would
exercise powerful control over how our creative culture would develop.
</p><p>

I have two purposes in this chapter. The first is to convince you that,
historically, Valenti's claim is absolutely wrong. The second is to convince
you that it would be terribly wrong for us to reject our history.  We have
always treated rights in creative property differently from the rights
resident in all other property owners. They have never been the same. And
they should never be the same, because, however counterintuitive this may
seem, to make them the same would be to fundamentally weaken the opportunity
for new creators to create.  Creativity depends upon the owners of
creativity having less than perfect control.
</p><p>
Organizations such as the MPAA, whose board includes the most powerful of
the old guard, have little interest, their rhetoric notwithstanding, in
assuring that the new can displace them. No organization does. No person
does. (Ask me about tenure, for example.)  But what's good for the MPAA is
not necessarily good for America. A society that defends the ideals of free
culture must preserve precisely the opportunity for new creativity to
threaten the old.  To get just a hint that there is something fundamentally
wrong in Valenti's argument, we need look no further than the United States
Constitution itself.
</p><p>
The framers of our Constitution loved "property." Indeed, so strongly did
they love property that they built into the Constitution an important
requirement. If the government takes your property&#8212;if it condemns your
house, or acquires a slice of land from your farm&#8212;it is required,
under the Fifth Amendment's "Takings Clause," to pay you "just compensation"
for that taking. The Constitution thus guarantees that property is, in a
certain sense, sacred. It cannot <span class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> be taken from the
property owner unless the government pays for the privilege.
</p><p>

Yet the very same Constitution speaks very differently about what Valenti
calls "creative property." In the clause granting Congress the power to
create "creative property," the Constitution <span class="emphasis"><em>requires</em></span>
that after a "limited time," Congress take back the rights that it has
granted and set the "creative property" free to the public domain. Yet when
Congress does this, when the expiration of a copyright term "takes" your
copyright and turns it over to the public domain, Congress does not have any
obligation to pay "just compensation" for this "taking." Instead, the same
Constitution that requires compensation for your land requires that you lose
your "creative property" right without any compensation at all.
</p><p>
The Constitution thus on its face states that these two forms of property
are not to be accorded the same rights. They are plainly to be treated
differently. Valenti is therefore not just asking for a change in our
tradition when he argues that creative-property owners should be accorded
the same rights as every other property-right owner. He is effectively
arguing for a change in our Constitution itself.
</p><p>
Arguing for a change in our Constitution is not necessarily wrong.  There
was much in our original Constitution that was plainly wrong.  The
Constitution of 1789 entrenched slavery; it left senators to be appointed
rather than elected; it made it possible for the electoral college to
produce a tie between the president and his own vice president (as it did in
1800). The framers were no doubt extraordinary, but I would be the first to
admit that they made big mistakes. We have since rejected some of those
mistakes; no doubt there could be others that we should reject as well. So
my argument is not simply that because Jefferson did it, we should, too.
</p><p>
Instead, my argument is that because Jefferson did it, we should at least
try to understand <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span>. Why did the framers, fanatical
property types that they were, reject the claim that creative property be
given the same rights as all other property? Why did they require that for
creative property there must be a public domain?
</p><p>
To answer this question, we need to get some perspective on the history of
these "creative property" rights, and the control that they enabled.  Once
we see clearly how differently these rights have been defined, we will be in
a better position to ask the question that should be at the core of this
war: Not <span class="emphasis"><em>whether</em></span> creative property should be protected,
but how. Not <span class="emphasis"><em>whether</em></span> we will enforce the rights the law
gives to creative-property owners, but what the particular mix of rights
ought to be. Not <span class="emphasis"><em>whether</em></span> artists should be paid, but
whether institutions designed to assure that artists get paid need also
control how culture develops.
</p><p>



To answer these questions, we need a more general way to talk about how
property is protected. More precisely, we need a more general way than the
narrow language of the law allows. In <em class="citetitle">Code and Other Laws of
Cyberspace</em>, I used a simple model to capture this more general
perspective. For any particular right or regulation, this model asks how
four different modalities of regulation interact to support or weaken the
right or regulation. I represented it with this diagram:
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1331"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.1. How four different modalities of regulation interact to support or weaken
the right or regulation.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1331.png" alt="How four different modalities of regulation interact to support or weaken the right or regulation."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
At the center of this picture is a regulated dot: the individual or group
that is the target of regulation, or the holder of a right. (In each case
throughout, we can describe this either as regulation or as a right.  For
simplicity's sake, I will speak only of regulations.)  The ovals represent
four ways in which the individual or group might be regulated&#8212; either
constrained or, alternatively, enabled. Law is the most obvious constraint
(to lawyers, at least). It constrains by threatening punishments after the
fact if the rules set in advance are violated. So if, for example, you
willfully infringe Madonna's copyright by copying a song from her latest CD
and posting it on the Web, you can be punished with a $150,000 fine. The
fine is an ex post punishment for violating an ex ante rule. It is imposed
by the state.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2692968"></a>
</p><p>
Norms are a different kind of constraint. They, too, punish an individual
for violating a rule. But the punishment of a norm is imposed by a
community, not (or not only) by the state. There may be no law against
spitting, but that doesn't mean you won't be punished if you spit on the
ground while standing in line at a movie. The punishment might not be harsh,
though depending upon the community, it could easily be more harsh than many
of the punishments imposed by the state. The mark of the difference is not
the severity of the rule, but the source of the enforcement.
</p><p>
The market is a third type of constraint. Its constraint is effected through
conditions: You can do X if you pay Y; you'll be paid M if you do N. These
constraints are obviously not independent of law or norms&#8212;it is
property law that defines what must be bought if it is to be taken legally;
it is norms that say what is appropriately sold. But given a set of norms,
and a background of property and contract law, the market imposes a
simultaneous constraint upon how an individual or group might behave.
</p><p>
Finally, and for the moment, perhaps, most mysteriously,
"architecture"&#8212;the physical world as one finds it&#8212;is a
constraint on behavior.  A fallen bridge might constrain your ability to get
across a river. Railroad tracks might constrain the ability of a community
to integrate its social life. As with the market, architecture does not
effect its constraint through ex post punishments. Instead, also as with the
market, architecture effects its constraint through simultaneous
conditions. These conditions are imposed not by courts enforcing contracts,
or by police punishing theft, but by nature, by "architecture." If a
500-pound boulder blocks your way, it is the law of gravity that enforces
this constraint. If a $500 airplane ticket stands between you and a flight
to New York, it is the market that enforces this constraint.
</p><p>



So the first point about these four modalities of regulation is obvious:
They interact. Restrictions imposed by one might be reinforced by
another. Or restrictions imposed by one might be undermined by another.
</p><p>
The second point follows directly: If we want to understand the effective
freedom that anyone has at a given moment to do any particular thing, we
have to consider how these four modalities interact.  Whether or not there
are other constraints (there may well be; my claim is not about
comprehensiveness), these four are among the most significant, and any
regulator (whether controlling or freeing)  must consider how these four in
particular interact.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxdrivespeed"></a><p>
So, for example, consider the "freedom" to drive a car at a high speed. That
freedom is in part restricted by laws: speed limits that say how fast you
can drive in particular places at particular times. It is in part restricted
by architecture: speed bumps, for example, slow most rational drivers;
governors in buses, as another example, set the maximum rate at which the
driver can drive. The freedom is in part restricted by the market: Fuel
efficiency drops as speed increases, thus the price of gasoline indirectly
constrains speed. And finally, the norms of a community may or may not
constrain the freedom to speed. Drive at 50 mph by a school in your own
neighborhood and you're likely to be punished by the neighbors. The same
norm wouldn't be as effective in a different town, or at night.
</p><p>

The final point about this simple model should also be fairly clear: While
these four modalities are analytically independent, law has a special role
in affecting the three.<sup>[<a name="id2693378" href="#ftn.id2693378" class="footnote">120</a>]</sup> The law, in
other words, sometimes operates to increase or decrease the constraint of a
particular modality.  Thus, the law might be used to increase taxes on
gasoline, so as to increase the incentives to drive more slowly. The law
might be used to mandate more speed bumps, so as to increase the difficulty
of driving rapidly. The law might be used to fund ads that stigmatize
reckless driving. Or the law might be used to require that other laws be
more strict&#8212;a federal requirement that states decrease the speed
limit, for example&#8212;so as to decrease the attractiveness of fast
driving.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2693398"></a><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1361"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.2. Law has a special role in affecting the three.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1361.png" alt="Law has a special role in affecting the three."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
These constraints can thus change, and they can be changed. To understand
the effective protection of liberty or protection of property at any
particular moment, we must track these changes over time. A restriction
imposed by one modality might be erased by another. A freedom enabled by one
modality might be displaced by another.<sup>[<a name="id2693443" href="#ftn.id2693443" class="footnote">121</a>]</sup>
</p><div class="section" title="Hvorfor Hollywood har rett"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="hollywood"></a>Hvorfor Hollywood har rett</h2></div></div></div><p>
The most obvious point that this model reveals is just why, or just how,
Hollywood is right. The copyright warriors have rallied Congress and the
courts to defend copyright. This model helps us see why that rallying makes
sense.
</p><p>
Let's say this is the picture of copyright's regulation before the Internet:
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1371"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.3. Copyright's regulation before the Internet.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1331.png" alt="Copyright's regulation before the Internet."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>


There is balance between law, norms, market, and architecture. The law
limits the ability to copy and share content, by imposing penalties on those
who copy and share content. Those penalties are reinforced by technologies
that make it hard to copy and share content (architecture) and expensive to
copy and share content (market). Finally, those penalties are mitigated by
norms we all recognize&#8212;kids, for example, taping other kids'
records. These uses of copyrighted material may well be infringement, but
the norms of our society (before the Internet, at least) had no problem with
this form of infringement.
</p><p>
Enter the Internet, or, more precisely, technologies such as MP3s and p2p
sharing. Now the constraint of architecture changes dramatically, as does
the constraint of the market. And as both the market and architecture relax
the regulation of copyright, norms pile on. The happy balance (for the
warriors, at least) of life before the Internet becomes an effective state
of anarchy after the Internet.
</p><p>

Thus the sense of, and justification for, the warriors' response.
Technology has changed, the warriors say, and the effect of this change,
when ramified through the market and norms, is that a balance of protection
for the copyright owners' rights has been lost. This is Iraq after the fall
of Saddam, but this time no government is justifying the looting that
results.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1381"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.4. effective state of anarchy after the Internet.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1381.png" alt="effective state of anarchy after the Internet."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
Neither this analysis nor the conclusions that follow are new to the
warriors. Indeed, in a "White Paper" prepared by the Commerce Department
(one heavily influenced by the copyright warriors) in 1995, this mix of
regulatory modalities had already been identified and the strategy to
respond already mapped. In response to the changes the Internet had
effected, the White Paper argued (1) Congress should strengthen intellectual
property law, (2) businesses should adopt innovative marketing techniques,
(3) technologists should push to develop code to protect copyrighted
material, and (4) educators should educate kids to better protect copyright.
</p><p>

This mixed strategy is just what copyright needed&#8212;if it was to
preserve the particular balance that existed before the change induced by
the Internet. And it's just what we should expect the content industry to
push for. It is as American as apple pie to consider the happy life you have
as an entitlement, and to look to the law to protect it if something comes
along to change that happy life. Homeowners living in a flood plain have no
hesitation appealing to the government to rebuild (and rebuild again) when a
flood (architecture) wipes away their property (law). Farmers have no
hesitation appealing to the government to bail them out when a virus
(architecture) devastates their crop. Unions have no hesitation appealing to
the government to bail them out when imports (market) wipe out the
U.S. steel industry.
</p><p>
Thus, there's nothing wrong or surprising in the content industry's campaign
to protect itself from the harmful consequences of a technological
innovation. And I would be the last person to argue that the changing
technology of the Internet has not had a profound effect on the content
industry's way of doing business, or as John Seely Brown describes it, its
"architecture of revenue."
</p><p>
But just because a particular interest asks for government support, it
doesn't follow that support should be granted. And just because technology
has weakened a particular way of doing business, it doesn't follow that the
government should intervene to support that old way of doing
business. Kodak, for example, has lost perhaps as much as 20 percent of
their traditional film market to the emerging technologies of digital
cameras.<sup>[<a name="id2693653" href="#ftn.id2693653" class="footnote">122</a>]</sup> Does anyone believe the
government should ban digital cameras just to support Kodak? Highways have
weakened the freight business for railroads. Does anyone think we should ban
trucks from roads <span class="emphasis"><em>for the purpose of</em></span> protecting the
railroads? Closer to the subject of this book, remote channel changers have
weakened the "stickiness" of television advertising (if a boring commercial
comes on the TV, the remote makes it easy to surf ), and it may well be that
this change has weakened the television advertising market. But does anyone
believe we should regulate remotes to reinforce commercial television?
(Maybe by limiting them to function only once a second, or to switch to only
ten channels within an hour?)
</p><p>
The obvious answer to these obviously rhetorical questions is no.  In a free
society, with a free market, supported by free enterprise and free trade,
the government's role is not to support one way of doing business against
others. Its role is not to pick winners and protect them against loss. If
the government did this generally, then we would never have any progress. As
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates wrote in 1991, in a memo criticizing software
patents, "established companies have an interest in excluding future
competitors."<sup>[<a name="id2693702" href="#ftn.id2693702" class="footnote">123</a>]</sup> And relative to a
startup, established companies also have the means. (Think RCA and FM
radio.) A world in which competitors with new ideas must fight not only the
market but also the government is a world in which competitors with new
ideas will not succeed. It is a world of stasis and increasingly
concentrated stagnation. It is the Soviet Union under Brezhnev.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2693722"></a>
</p><p>
Thus, while it is understandable for industries threatened with new
technologies that change the way they do business to look to the government
for protection, it is the special duty of policy makers to guarantee that
that protection not become a deterrent to progress. It is the duty of policy
makers, in other words, to assure that the changes they create, in response
to the request of those hurt by changing technology, are changes that
preserve the incentives and opportunities for innovation and change.
</p><p>
In the context of laws regulating speech&#8212;which include, obviously,
copyright law&#8212;that duty is even stronger. When the industry
complaining about changing technologies is asking Congress to respond in a
way that burdens speech and creativity, policy makers should be especially
wary of the request. It is always a bad deal for the government to get into
the business of regulating speech markets. The risks and dangers of that
game are precisely why our framers created the First Amendment to our
Constitution: "Congress shall make no law . . .  abridging the freedom of
speech." So when Congress is being asked to pass laws that would "abridge"
the freedom of speech, it should ask&#8212; carefully&#8212;whether such
regulation is justified.
</p><p>

My argument just now, however, has nothing to do with whether the changes
that are being pushed by the copyright warriors are "justified." My argument
is about their effect. For before we get to the question of justification, a
hard question that depends a great deal upon your values, we should first
ask whether we understand the effect of the changes the content industry
wants.
</p><p>
Her kommer metaforen som vil forklare argumentet.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxddt"></a><p>
In 1873, the chemical DDT was first synthesized. In 1948, Swiss chemist Paul
Hermann Müller won the Nobel Prize for his work demonstrating the
insecticidal properties of DDT. By the 1950s, the insecticide was widely
used around the world to kill disease-carrying pests. It was also used to
increase farm production.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2693799"></a>
</p><p>
No one doubts that killing disease-carrying pests or increasing crop
production is a good thing. No one doubts that the work of Müller was
important and valuable and probably saved lives, possibly millions.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2693816"></a><p>
But in 1962, Rachel Carson published <em class="citetitle">Silent Spring</em>,
which argued that DDT, whatever its primary benefits, was also having
unintended environmental consequences. Birds were losing the ability to
reproduce.  Whole chains of the ecology were being destroyed.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2693832"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2693838"></a>
</p><p>
No one set out to destroy the environment. Paul Müller certainly did not aim
to harm any birds. But the effort to solve one set of problems produced
another set which, in the view of some, was far worse than the problems that
were originally attacked. Or more accurately, the problems DDT caused were
worse than the problems it solved, at least when considering the other, more
environmentally friendly ways to solve the problems that DDT was meant to
solve.
</p><p>

It is to this image precisely that Duke University law professor James Boyle
appeals when he argues that we need an "environmentalism" for
culture.<sup>[<a name="id2693868" href="#ftn.id2693868" class="footnote">124</a>]</sup> His point, and the point I
want to develop in the balance of this chapter, is not that the aims of
copyright are flawed. Or that authors should not be paid for their work. Or
that music should be given away "for free." The point is that some of the
ways in which we might protect authors will have unintended consequences for
the cultural environment, much like DDT had for the natural environment. And
just as criticism of DDT is not an endorsement of malaria or an attack on
farmers, so, too, is criticism of one particular set of regulations
protecting copyright not an endorsement of anarchy or an attack on authors.
It is an environment of creativity that we seek, and we should be aware of
our actions' effects on the environment.
</p><p>
My argument, in the balance of this chapter, tries to map exactly this
effect. No doubt the technology of the Internet has had a dramatic effect on
the ability of copyright owners to protect their content. But there should
also be little doubt that when you add together the changes in copyright law
over time, plus the change in technology that the Internet is undergoing
just now, the net effect of these changes will not be only that copyrighted
work is effectively protected. Also, and generally missed, the net effect of
this massive increase in protection will be devastating to the environment
for creativity.
</p><p>
In a line: To kill a gnat, we are spraying DDT with consequences for free
culture that will be far more devastating than that this gnat will be lost.

America copied English copyright law. Actually, we copied and improved
English copyright law. Our Constitution makes the purpose of "creative
property" rights clear; its express limitations reinforce the English aim to
avoid overly powerful publishers.
</p><p>
The power to establish "creative property" rights is granted to Congress in
a way that, for our Constitution, at least, is very odd. Article I, section
8, clause 8 of our Constitution states that:
</p><p>

Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,
by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right
to their respective Writings and Discoveries.  We can call this the
"Progress Clause," for notice what this clause does not say. It does not say
Congress has the power to grant "creative property rights." It says that
Congress has the power <span class="emphasis"><em>to promote progress</em></span>. The grant
of power is its purpose, and its purpose is a public one, not the purpose of
enriching publishers, nor even primarily the purpose of rewarding authors.
</p><p>
The Progress Clause expressly limits the term of copyrights. As we saw in
chapter <a class="xref" href="#founders" title="Kapittel 7. Kapittel seks: Grunnleggerne">7</a>, the
English limited the term of copyright so as to assure that a few would not
exercise disproportionate control over culture by exercising
disproportionate control over publishing. We can assume the framers followed
the English for a similar purpose. Indeed, unlike the English, the framers
reinforced that objective, by requiring that copyrights extend "to Authors"
only.
</p><p>
The design of the Progress Clause reflects something about the
Constitution's design in general. To avoid a problem, the framers built
structure. To prevent the concentrated power of publishers, they built a
structure that kept copyrights away from publishers and kept them short. To
prevent the concentrated power of a church, they banned the federal
government from establishing a church. To prevent concentrating power in the
federal government, they built structures to reinforce the power of the
states&#8212;including the Senate, whose members were at the time selected
by the states, and an electoral college, also selected by the states, to
select the president. In each case, a <span class="emphasis"><em>structure</em></span> built
checks and balances into the constitutional frame, structured to prevent
otherwise inevitable concentrations of power.
</p><p>
I doubt the framers would recognize the regulation we call "copyright"
today. The scope of that regulation is far beyond anything they ever
considered. To begin to understand what they did, we need to put our
"copyright" in context: We need to see how it has changed in the 210 years
since they first struck its design.
</p><p>

Some of these changes come from the law: some in light of changes in
technology, and some in light of changes in technology given a particular
concentration of market power. In terms of our model, we started here:

When the first Congress enacted laws to protect creative property, it faced
the same uncertainty about the status of creative property that the English
had confronted in 1774. Many states had passed laws protecting creative
property, and some believed that these laws simply supplemented common law
rights that already protected creative authorship.<sup>[<a name="id2694083" href="#ftn.id2694083" class="footnote">125</a>]</sup> This meant that there was no guaranteed public
domain in the United States in 1790. If copyrights were protected by the
common law, then there was no simple way to know whether a work published in
the United States was controlled or free. Just as in England, this lingering
uncertainty would make it hard for publishers to rely upon a public domain
to reprint and distribute works.
</p><p>
That uncertainty ended after Congress passed legislation granting
copyrights. Because federal law overrides any contrary state law, federal
protections for copyrighted works displaced any state law protections.  Just
as in England the Statute of Anne eventually meant that the copyrights for
all English works expired, a federal statute meant that any state copyrights
expired as well.
</p><p>
In 1790, Congress enacted the first copyright law. It created a federal
copyright and secured that copyright for fourteen years. If the author was
alive at the end of that fourteen years, then he could opt to renew the
copyright for another fourteen years. If he did not renew the copyright, his
work passed into the public domain.
</p><p>
Selv om det ble skapt mange verker i USA i de første 10 årene til
republikken, så ble kun 5 prosent av verkene registrert under det føderale
opphavsrettsregimet.  Av alle verker skapt i USA både før 1790 og fra 1790
fram til 1800, så ble 95 prosent øyeblikkelig allemannseie (public
domain). Resten ble allemannseie etter maksimalt 20 år, og som oftest etter
14 år.<sup>[<a name="id2694148" href="#ftn.id2694148" class="footnote">126</a>]</sup>
</p><p>

Dette fornyelsessystemet var en avgjørende del av det amerikanske systemet
for opphavsrett.  Det sikret at maksimal vernetid i opphavsretten bare ble
gitt til verker der det var ønsket. Etter den første perioden på fjorten år,
hvis forfatteren ikke så verdien av å fornye sin opphavsrett, var det heller
ikke verdt det for samfunnet å håndheve opphavsretten.
</p><p>
Fourteen years may not seem long to us, but for the vast majority of
copyright owners at that time, it was long enough: Only a small minority of
them renewed their copyright after fourteen years; the balance allowed their
work to pass into the public domain.<sup>[<a name="id2694215" href="#ftn.id2694215" class="footnote">127</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Even today, this structure would make sense. Most creative work has an
actual commercial life of just a couple of years. Most books fall out of
print after one year.<sup>[<a name="id2694243" href="#ftn.id2694243" class="footnote">128</a>]</sup> When that
happens, the used books are traded free of copyright regulation. Thus the
books are no longer <span class="emphasis"><em>effectively</em></span> controlled by
copyright. The only practical commercial use of the books at that time is to
sell the books as used books; that use&#8212;because it does not involve
publication&#8212;is effectively free.
</p><p>
In the first hundred years of the Republic, the term of copyright was
changed once. In 1831, the term was increased from a maximum of 28 years to
a maximum of 42 by increasing the initial term of copyright from 14 years to
28 years. In the next fifty years of the Republic, the term increased once
again. In 1909, Congress extended the renewal term of 14 years to 28 years,
setting a maximum term of 56 years.
</p><p>
Then, beginning in 1962, Congress started a practice that has defined
copyright law since. Eleven times in the last forty years, Congress has
extended the terms of existing copyrights; twice in those forty years,
Congress extended the term of future copyrights. Initially, the extensions
of existing copyrights were short, a mere one to two years.  In 1976,
Congress extended all existing copyrights by nineteen years.  And in 1998,
in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, Congress extended the term
of existing and future copyrights by twenty years.
</p><p>

The effect of these extensions is simply to toll, or delay, the passing of
works into the public domain. This latest extension means that the public
domain will have been tolled for thirty-nine out of fifty-five years, or 70
percent of the time since 1962. Thus, in the twenty years after the Sonny
Bono Act, while one million patents will pass into the public domain, zero
copyrights will pass into the public domain by virtue of the expiration of a
copyright term.
</p><p>
The effect of these extensions has been exacerbated by another,
little-noticed change in the copyright law. Remember I said that the framers
established a two-part copyright regime, requiring a copyright owner to
renew his copyright after an initial term. The requirement of renewal meant
that works that no longer needed copyright protection would pass more
quickly into the public domain. The works remaining under protection would
be those that had some continuing commercial value.
</p><p>
The United States abandoned this sensible system in 1976. For all works
created after 1978, there was only one copyright term&#8212;the maximum
term. For "natural" authors, that term was life plus fifty years. For
corporations, the term was seventy-five years. Then, in 1992, Congress
abandoned the renewal requirement for all works created before 1978. All
works still under copyright would be accorded the maximum term then
available. After the Sonny Bono Act, that term was ninety-five years.
</p><p>
This change meant that American law no longer had an automatic way to assure
that works that were no longer exploited passed into the public domain. And
indeed, after these changes, it is unclear whether it is even possible to
put works into the public domain. The public domain is orphaned by these
changes in copyright law. Despite the requirement that terms be "limited,"
we have no evidence that anything will limit them.
</p><p>
The effect of these changes on the average duration of copyright is
dramatic. In 1973, more than 85 percent of copyright owners failed to renew
their copyright. That meant that the average term of copyright in 1973 was
just 32.2 years. Because of the elimination of the renewal requirement, the
average term of copyright is now the maximum term.  In thirty years, then,
the average term has tripled, from 32.2 years to 95 years.<sup>[<a name="id2694339" href="#ftn.id2694339" class="footnote">129</a>]</sup>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Loven: Virkeområde"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="lawscope"></a>Loven: Virkeområde</h2></div></div></div><p>
The "scope" of a copyright is the range of rights granted by the law.  The
scope of American copyright has changed dramatically. Those changes are not
necessarily bad. But we should understand the extent of the changes if we're
to keep this debate in context.
</p><p>
In 1790, that scope was very narrow. Copyright covered only "maps, charts,
and books." That means it didn't cover, for example, music or
architecture. More significantly, the right granted by a copyright gave the
author the exclusive right to "publish" copyrighted works. That means
someone else violated the copyright only if he republished the work without
the copyright owner's permission. Finally, the right granted by a copyright
was an exclusive right to that particular book. The right did not extend to
what lawyers call "derivative works." It would not, therefore, interfere
with the right of someone other than the author to translate a copyrighted
book, or to adapt the story to a different form (such as a drama based on a
published book).
</p><p>
This, too, has changed dramatically. While the contours of copyright today
are extremely hard to describe simply, in general terms, the right covers
practically any creative work that is reduced to a tangible form. It covers
music as well as architecture, drama as well as computer programs. It gives
the copyright owner of that creative work not only the exclusive right to
"publish" the work, but also the exclusive right of control over any
"copies" of that work. And most significant for our purposes here, the right
gives the copyright owner control over not only his or her particular work,
but also any "derivative work" that might grow out of the original work. In
this way, the right covers more creative work, protects the creative work
more broadly, and protects works that are based in a significant way on the
initial creative work.
</p><p>

At the same time that the scope of copyright has expanded, procedural
limitations on the right have been relaxed. I've already described the
complete removal of the renewal requirement in 1992. In addition to the
renewal requirement, for most of the history of American copyright law,
there was a requirement that a work be registered before it could receive
the protection of a copyright. There was also a requirement that any
copyrighted work be marked either with that famous © or the word
<span class="emphasis"><em>copyright</em></span>. And for most of the history of American
copyright law, there was a requirement that works be deposited with the
government before a copyright could be secured.
</p><p>
The reason for the registration requirement was the sensible understanding
that for most works, no copyright was required. Again, in the first ten
years of the Republic, 95 percent of works eligible for copyright were never
copyrighted. Thus, the rule reflected the norm: Most works apparently didn't
need copyright, so registration narrowed the regulation of the law to the
few that did. The same reasoning justified the requirement that a work be
marked as copyrighted&#8212;that way it was easy to know whether a copyright
was being claimed. The requirement that works be deposited was to assure
that after the copyright expired, there would be a copy of the work
somewhere so that it could be copied by others without locating the original
author.
</p><p>
All of these "formalities" were abolished in the American system when we
decided to follow European copyright law. There is no requirement that you
register a work to get a copyright; the copyright now is automatic; the
copyright exists whether or not you mark your work with a ©; and the
copyright exists whether or not you actually make a copy available for
others to copy.
</p><p>
Vurder et praktisk eksempel for å forstå omfanget av disse forskjellene.
</p><p>
If, in 1790, you wrote a book and you were one of the 5 percent who actually
copyrighted that book, then the copyright law protected you against another
publisher's taking your book and republishing it without your
permission. The aim of the act was to regulate publishers so as to prevent
that kind of unfair competition. In 1790, there were 174 publishers in the
United States.<sup>[<a name="id2694464" href="#ftn.id2694464" class="footnote">130</a>]</sup> The Copyright Act was
thus a tiny regulation of a tiny proportion of a tiny part of the creative
market in the United States&#8212;publishers.
</p><p>


The act left other creators totally unregulated. If I copied your poem by
hand, over and over again, as a way to learn it by heart, my act was totally
unregulated by the 1790 act. If I took your novel and made a play based upon
it, or if I translated it or abridged it, none of those activities were
regulated by the original copyright act. These creative activities remained
free, while the activities of publishers were restrained.
</p><p>
Today the story is very different: If you write a book, your book is
automatically protected. Indeed, not just your book. Every e-mail, every
note to your spouse, every doodle, <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> creative act
that's reduced to a tangible form&#8212;all of this is automatically
copyrighted.  There is no need to register or mark your work. The protection
follows the creation, not the steps you take to protect it.
</p><p>
That protection gives you the right (subject to a narrow range of fair use
exceptions) to control how others copy the work, whether they copy it to
republish it or to share an excerpt.
</p><p>
That much is the obvious part. Any system of copyright would control
competing publishing. But there's a second part to the copyright of today
that is not at all obvious. This is the protection of "derivative rights."
If you write a book, no one can make a movie out of your book without
permission. No one can translate it without permission.  CliffsNotes can't
make an abridgment unless permission is granted. All of these derivative
uses of your original work are controlled by the copyright holder. The
copyright, in other words, is now not just an exclusive right to your
writings, but an exclusive right to your writings and a large proportion of
the writings inspired by them.
</p><p>
It is this derivative right that would seem most bizarre to our framers,
though it has become second nature to us. Initially, this expansion was
created to deal with obvious evasions of a narrower copyright.  If I write a
book, can you change one word and then claim a copyright in a new and
different book? Obviously that would make a joke of the copyright, so the
law was properly expanded to include those slight modifications as well as
the verbatim original work.
</p><p>

In preventing that joke, the law created an astonishing power within a free
culture&#8212;at least, it's astonishing when you understand that the law
applies not just to the commercial publisher but to anyone with a
computer. I understand the wrong in duplicating and selling someone else's
work. But whatever <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> wrong is, transforming someone
else's work is a different wrong. Some view transformation as no wrong at
all&#8212;they believe that our law, as the framers penned it, should not
protect derivative rights at all.<sup>[<a name="id2694556" href="#ftn.id2694556" class="footnote">131</a>]</sup>
Whether or not you go that far, it seems plain that whatever wrong is
involved is fundamentally different from the wrong of direct piracy.
</p><p>
Yet copyright law treats these two different wrongs in the same way. I can
go to court and get an injunction against your pirating my book. I can go to
court and get an injunction against your transformative use of my
book.<sup>[<a name="id2694602" href="#ftn.id2694602" class="footnote">132</a>]</sup> These two different uses of my
creative work are treated the same.
</p><p>
This again may seem right to you. If I wrote a book, then why should you be
able to write a movie that takes my story and makes money from it without
paying me or crediting me? Or if Disney creates a creature called "Mickey
Mouse," why should you be able to make Mickey Mouse toys and be the one to
trade on the value that Disney originally created?
</p><p>
These are good arguments, and, in general, my point is not that the
derivative right is unjustified. My aim just now is much narrower: simply to
make clear that this expansion is a significant change from the rights
originally granted.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Lov og arkitektur: Rekkevidde"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="lawreach"></a>Lov og arkitektur: Rekkevidde</h2></div></div></div><p>
Whereas originally the law regulated only publishers, the change in
copyright's scope means that the law today regulates publishers, users, and
authors. It regulates them because all three are capable of making copies,
and the core of the regulation of copyright law is copies.<sup>[<a name="id2694652" href="#ftn.id2694652" class="footnote">133</a>]</sup>
</p><p>


"Copies." That certainly sounds like the obvious thing for
<span class="emphasis"><em>copy</em></span>right law to regulate. But as with Jack Valenti's
argument at the start of this chapter, that "creative property" deserves the
"same rights" as all other property, it is the <span class="emphasis"><em>obvious</em></span>
that we need to be most careful about. For while it may be obvious that in
the world before the Internet, copies were the obvious trigger for copyright
law, upon reflection, it should be obvious that in the world with the
Internet, copies should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be the trigger for
copyright law. More precisely, they should not <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span>
be the trigger for copyright law.
</p><p>
This is perhaps the central claim of this book, so let me take this very
slowly so that the point is not easily missed. My claim is that the Internet
should at least force us to rethink the conditions under which the law of
copyright automatically applies,<sup>[<a name="id2694713" href="#ftn.id2694713" class="footnote">134</a>]</sup>
because it is clear that the current reach of copyright was never
contemplated, much less chosen, by the legislators who enacted copyright
law.
</p><p>
We can see this point abstractly by beginning with this largely empty
circle.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1521"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.7. Alle potensielle bruk av en bok.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1521.png" alt="Alle potensielle bruk av en bok."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>


Think about a book in real space, and imagine this circle to represent all
its potential <span class="emphasis"><em>uses</em></span>. Most of these uses are unregulated
by copyright law, because the uses don't create a copy. If you read a book,
that act is not regulated by copyright law. If you give someone the book,
that act is not regulated by copyright law. If you resell a book, that act
is not regulated (copyright law expressly states that after the first sale
of a book, the copyright owner can impose no further conditions on the
disposition of the book). If you sleep on the book or use it to hold up a
lamp or let your puppy chew it up, those acts are not regulated by copyright
law, because those acts do not make a copy.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1531"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.8. Eksempler på uregulert bruk av en bok.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1531.png" alt="Eksempler på uregulert bruk av en bok."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
Obviously, however, some uses of a copyrighted book are regulated by
copyright law. Republishing the book, for example, makes a copy. It is
therefore regulated by copyright law. Indeed, this particular use stands at
the core of this circle of possible uses of a copyrighted work. It is the
paradigmatic use properly regulated by copyright regulation (see first
diagram on next page).
</p><p>
Til slutt er det en tynn skive av ellers regulert kopierings-bruk som
forblir uregluert på grunn av at loven anser dette som "rimelig bruk".
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1541"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.9. Republishing stands at the core of this circle of possible uses of a
copyrighted work.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1541.png" alt="Republishing stands at the core of this circle of possible uses of a copyrighted work."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
These are uses that themselves involve copying, but which the law treats as
unregulated because public policy demands that they remain unregulated.  You
are free to quote from this book, even in a review that is quite negative,
without my permission, even though that quoting makes a copy. That copy
would ordinarily give the copyright owner the exclusive right to say whether
the copy is allowed or not, but the law denies the owner any exclusive right
over such "fair uses" for public policy (and possibly First Amendment)
reasons.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1542"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.10. Uregulert kopiering anses som "rimelig bruk".</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1542.png" alt='Uregulert kopiering anses som "rimelig bruk".'></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p> </p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1551"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.11. Uses that before were presumptively unregulated are now presumptively
regulated.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1551.png" alt="Uses that before were presumptively unregulated are now presumptively regulated."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>


In real space, then, the possible uses of a book are divided into three
sorts: (1) unregulated uses, (2) regulated uses, and (3) regulated uses that
are nonetheless deemed "fair" regardless of the copyright owner's views.
</p><p>
Enter the Internet&#8212;a distributed, digital network where every use of a
copyrighted work produces a copy.<sup>[<a name="id2694659" href="#ftn.id2694659" class="footnote">135</a>]</sup> And
because of this single, arbitrary feature of the design of a digital
network, the scope of category 1 changes dramatically. Uses that before were
presumptively unregulated are now presumptively regulated. No longer is
there a set of presumptively unregulated uses that define a freedom
associated with a copyrighted work. Instead, each use is now subject to the
copyright, because each use also makes a copy&#8212;category 1 gets sucked
into category 2. And those who would defend the unregulated uses of
copyrighted work must look exclusively to category 3, fair uses, to bear the
burden of this shift.
</p><p>

So let's be very specific to make this general point clear. Before the
Internet, if you purchased a book and read it ten times, there would be no
plausible <span class="emphasis"><em>copyright</em></span>-related argument that the copyright
owner could make to control that use of her book. Copyright law would have
nothing to say about whether you read the book once, ten times, or every
night before you went to bed. None of those instances of
use&#8212;reading&#8212; could be regulated by copyright law because none of
those uses produced a copy.
</p><p>
But the same book as an e-book is effectively governed by a different set of
rules. Now if the copyright owner says you may read the book only once or
only once a month, then <span class="emphasis"><em>copyright law</em></span> would aid the
copyright owner in exercising this degree of control, because of the
accidental feature of copyright law that triggers its application upon there
being a copy. Now if you read the book ten times and the license says you
may read it only five times, then whenever you read the book (or any portion
of it) beyond the fifth time, you are making a copy of the book contrary to
the copyright owner's wish.
</p><p>
There are some people who think this makes perfect sense. My aim just now is
not to argue about whether it makes sense or not. My aim is only to make
clear the change. Once you see this point, a few other points also become
clear:
</p><p>
First, making category 1 disappear is not anything any policy maker ever
intended. Congress did not think through the collapse of the presumptively
unregulated uses of copyrighted works. There is no evidence at all that
policy makers had this idea in mind when they allowed our policy here to
shift. Unregulated uses were an important part of free culture before the
Internet.
</p><p>
Second, this shift is especially troubling in the context of transformative
uses of creative content. Again, we can all understand the wrong in
commercial piracy. But the law now purports to regulate
<span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> transformation you make of creative work using a
machine. "Copy and paste" and "cut and paste" become crimes. Tinkering with
a story and releasing it to others exposes the tinkerer to at least a
requirement of justification.  However troubling the expansion with respect
to copying a particular work, it is extraordinarily troubling with respect
to transformative uses of creative work.
</p><p>

Third, this shift from category 1 to category 2 puts an extraordinary burden
on category 3 ("fair use") that fair use never before had to bear.  If a
copyright owner now tried to control how many times I could read a book
on-line, the natural response would be to argue that this is a violation of
my fair use rights. But there has never been any litigation about whether I
have a fair use right to read, because before the Internet, reading did not
trigger the application of copyright law and hence the need for a fair use
defense. The right to read was effectively protected before because reading
was not regulated.
</p><p>
This point about fair use is totally ignored, even by advocates for free
culture. We have been cornered into arguing that our rights depend upon fair
use&#8212;never even addressing the earlier question about the expansion in
effective regulation. A thin protection grounded in fair use makes sense
when the vast majority of uses are <span class="emphasis"><em>unregulated</em></span>. But
when everything becomes presumptively regulated, then the protections of
fair use are not enough.
</p><p>
The case of Video Pipeline is a good example. Video Pipeline was in the
business of making "trailer" advertisements for movies available to video
stores. The video stores displayed the trailers as a way to sell
videos. Video Pipeline got the trailers from the film distributors, put the
trailers on tape, and sold the tapes to the retail stores.
</p><p>
The company did this for about fifteen years. Then, in 1997, it began to
think about the Internet as another way to distribute these previews.  The
idea was to expand their "selling by sampling" technique by giving on-line
stores the same ability to enable "browsing." Just as in a bookstore you can
read a few pages of a book before you buy the book, so, too, you would be
able to sample a bit from the movie on-line before you bought it.
</p><p>

In 1998, Video Pipeline informed Disney and other film distributors that it
intended to distribute the trailers through the Internet (rather than
sending the tapes) to distributors of their videos. Two years later, Disney
told Video Pipeline to stop. The owner of Video Pipeline asked Disney to
talk about the matter&#8212;he had built a business on distributing this
content as a way to help sell Disney films; he had customers who depended
upon his delivering this content. Disney would agree to talk only if Video
Pipeline stopped the distribution immediately.  Video Pipeline thought it
was within their "fair use" rights to distribute the clips as they had. So
they filed a lawsuit to ask the court to declare that these rights were in
fact their rights.
</p><p>
Disney countersued&#8212;for $100 million in damages. Those damages were
predicated upon a claim that Video Pipeline had "willfully infringed" on
Disney's copyright. When a court makes a finding of willful infringement, it
can award damages not on the basis of the actual harm to the copyright
owner, but on the basis of an amount set in the statute. Because Video
Pipeline had distributed seven hundred clips of Disney movies to enable
video stores to sell copies of those movies, Disney was now suing Video
Pipeline for $100 million.
</p><p>
Disney has the right to control its property, of course. But the video
stores that were selling Disney's films also had some sort of right to be
able to sell the films that they had bought from Disney. Disney's claim in
court was that the stores were allowed to sell the films and they were
permitted to list the titles of the films they were selling, but they were
not allowed to show clips of the films as a way of selling them without
Disney's permission.
</p><p>
Now, you might think this is a close case, and I think the courts would
consider it a close case. My point here is to map the change that gives
Disney this power. Before the Internet, Disney couldn't really control how
people got access to their content. Once a video was in the marketplace, the
"first-sale doctrine" would free the seller to use the video as he wished,
including showing portions of it in order to engender sales of the entire
movie video. But with the Internet, it becomes possible for Disney to
centralize control over access to this content. Because each use of the
Internet produces a copy, use on the Internet becomes subject to the
copyright owner's control. The technology expands the scope of effective
control, because the technology builds a copy into every transaction.
</p><p>


No doubt, a potential is not yet an abuse, and so the potential for control
is not yet the abuse of control. Barnes &amp; Noble has the right to say you
can't touch a book in their store; property law gives them that right.  But
the market effectively protects against that abuse. If Barnes &amp; Noble
banned browsing, then consumers would choose other bookstores.  Competition
protects against the extremes. And it may well be (my argument so far does
not even question this) that competition would prevent any similar danger
when it comes to copyright. Sure, publishers exercising the rights that
authors have assigned to them might try to regulate how many times you read
a book, or try to stop you from sharing the book with anyone. But in a
competitive market such as the book market, the dangers of this happening
are quite slight.
</p><p>
Again, my aim so far is simply to map the changes that this changed
architecture enables. Enabling technology to enforce the control of
copyright means that the control of copyright is no longer defined by
balanced policy. The control of copyright is simply what private owners
choose. In some contexts, at least, that fact is harmless. But in some
contexts it is a recipe for disaster.

The disappearance of unregulated uses would be change enough, but a second
important change brought about by the Internet magnifies its
significance. This second change does not affect the reach of copyright
regulation; it affects how such regulation is enforced.
</p><p>
In the world before digital technology, it was generally the law that
controlled whether and how someone was regulated by copyright law.  The law,
meaning a court, meaning a judge: In the end, it was a human, trained in the
tradition of the law and cognizant of the balances that tradition embraced,
who said whether and how the law would restrict your freedom.

Det er en berømt historie om en kamp mellom Marx-brødrene (the Marx
Brothers) og Warner Brothers.  Marx-brødrene planla å lage en parodi av
<em class="citetitle">Casablanca</em>. Warner Brothers protesterte.  De skrev et
ufint brev til Marx-brødrene og advarte dem om at det ville få seriøse
juridiske konsekvenser hvis de gikk videre med sin plan.<sup>[<a name="id2695215" href="#ftn.id2695215" class="footnote">136</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Dette fikk Marx-brødrene til å svare tilbake med samme mynt.  De advarte
Warner Brothers om at Marx-brødrene "var brødre lenge før dere var
det".<sup>[<a name="id2695236" href="#ftn.id2695236" class="footnote">137</a>]</sup> Marx-brødrene eide derfor ordet
<em class="citetitle">Brothers</em>, og hvis Warner Brothers insisterte på å
forsøke å kontrollere <em class="citetitle">Casablanca</em>, så ville
Marx-brødrene insistere på kontroll over <em class="citetitle">Brothers</em>.
</p><p>
Det var en absurd og hul trussel, selvfølgelig, fordi Warner Brothers, på
samme måte som Marx-brødrene, visste at ingen domstol noensinne ville
håndheve et slikt dumt krav. Denne ekstremismen var irrelevant for de ekte
friheter som alle (inkludert Warner Brothers) nøt godt av.
</p><p>
On the Internet, however, there is no check on silly rules, because on the
Internet, increasingly, rules are enforced not by a human but by a machine:
Increasingly, the rules of copyright law, as interpreted by the copyright
owner, get built into the technology that delivers copyrighted content. It
is code, rather than law, that rules. And the problem with code regulations
is that, unlike law, code has no shame. Code would not get the humor of the
Marx Brothers. The consequence of that is not at all funny.

La oss se på livet til min Adobe eBook Reader.
</p><p>
En ebok er en bok levert i elektronisk form.  En Adobe eBook er ikke en bok
som Adobe har publisert.  Adobe produserer kun programvaren som utgivere
bruker å levere e-bøker.  Den bidrar med teknologien, og utgiveren leverer
innholdet ved hjelp av teknologien.
</p><p>
On the next page is a picture of an old version of my Adobe eBook Reader.
</p><p>

As you can see, I have a small collection of e-books within this e-book
library. Some of these books reproduce content that is in the public domain:
<em class="citetitle">Middlemarch</em>, for example, is in the public domain.
Some of them reproduce content that is not in the public domain: My own book
<em class="citetitle">The Future of Ideas</em> is not yet within the public
domain.  Consider <em class="citetitle">Middlemarch</em> first. If you click on
my e-book copy of <em class="citetitle">Middlemarch</em>, you'll see a fancy
cover, and then a button at the bottom called Permissions.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1611"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.12. Bilde av en gammel versjon av Adobe eBook Reader.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1611.png" alt="Bilde av en gammel versjon av Adobe eBook Reader."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
If you click on the Permissions button, you'll see a list of the permissions
that the publisher purports to grant with this book.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1612"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.13. List of the permissions that the publisher purports to grant.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1612.png" alt="List of the permissions that the publisher purports to grant."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>


According to my eBook Reader, I have the permission to copy to the clipboard
of the computer ten text selections every ten days. (So far, I've copied no
text to the clipboard.)  I also have the permission to print ten pages from
the book every ten days. Lastly, I have the permission to use the Read Aloud
button to hear <em class="citetitle">Middlemarch</em> read aloud through the
computer.
</p><p>
Her er e-boken for et annet allemannseid verk (inkludert oversettelsen):
Aristoteles <em class="citetitle">Politikk</em>  <a class="indexterm" name="id2695427"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2695433"></a>
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1621"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.14. E-bok av Aristoteles "Politikk"</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1621.png" alt='E-bok av Aristoteles "Politikk"'></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
According to its permissions, no printing or copying is permitted at
all. But fortunately, you can use the Read Aloud button to hear the book.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1622"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.15. Liste med tillatelser for Aristotles "Politikk".</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1622.png" alt='Liste med tillatelser for Aristotles "Politikk".'></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
Finally (and most embarrassingly), here are the permissions for the original
e-book version of my last book, <em class="citetitle">The Future of Ideas</em>:
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1631"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.16.

Ingen kopiering, ingen utskrift, og våg ikke å prøve å lytte til denne
boken!
</p><p>
Now, the Adobe eBook Reader calls these controls "permissions"&#8212; as if
the publisher has the power to control how you use these works.  For works
under copyright, the copyright owner certainly does have the power&#8212;up
to the limits of the copyright law. But for work not under copyright, there
is no such copyright power.<sup>[<a name="id2695512" href="#ftn.id2695512" class="footnote">138</a>]</sup> When my
e-book of <em class="citetitle">Middlemarch</em> says I have the permission to
copy only ten text selections into the memory every ten days, what that
really means is that the eBook Reader has enabled the publisher to control
how I use the book on my computer, far beyond the control that the law would
enable.
</p><p>
The control comes instead from the code&#8212;from the technology within
which the e-book "lives." Though the e-book says that these are permissions,
they are not the sort of "permissions" that most of us deal with. When a
teenager gets "permission" to stay out till midnight, she knows (unless
she's Cinderella) that she can stay out till 2 A.M., but will suffer a
punishment if she's caught. But when the Adobe eBook Reader says I have the
permission to make ten copies of the text into the computer's memory, that
means that after I've made ten copies, the computer will not make any
more. The same with the printing restrictions: After ten pages, the eBook
Reader will not print any more pages.  It's the same with the silly
restriction that says that you can't use the Read Aloud button to read my
book aloud&#8212;it's not that the company will sue you if you do; instead,
if you push the Read Aloud button with my book, the machine simply won't
read aloud.
</p><p>

These are <span class="emphasis"><em>controls</em></span>, not permissions. Imagine a world
where the Marx Brothers sold word processing software that, when you tried
to type "Warner Brothers," erased "Brothers" from the sentence.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2695568"></a>
</p><p>
This is the future of copyright law: not so much copyright
<span class="emphasis"><em>law</em></span> as copyright <span class="emphasis"><em>code</em></span>. The
controls over access to content will not be controls that are ratified by
courts; the controls over access to content will be controls that are coded
by programmers. And whereas the controls that are built into the law are
always to be checked by a judge, the controls that are built into the
technology have no similar built-in check.
</p><p>
How significant is this? Isn't it always possible to get around the controls
built into the technology? Software used to be sold with technologies that
limited the ability of users to copy the software, but those were trivial
protections to defeat. Why won't it be trivial to defeat these protections
as well?
</p><p>
We've only scratched the surface of this story. Return to the Adobe eBook
Reader.
</p><p>
Early in the life of the Adobe eBook Reader, Adobe suffered a public
relations nightmare. Among the books that you could download for free on the
Adobe site was a copy of <em class="citetitle">Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland</em>.  This wonderful book is in the public domain. Yet
when you clicked on Permissions for that book, you got the following report:
<a class="indexterm" name="id2695618"></a>
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1641"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.17. List of the permissions for "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1641.png" alt="List of the permissions for &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>


Here was a public domain children's book that you were not allowed to copy,
not allowed to lend, not allowed to give, and, as the "permissions"
indicated, not allowed to "read aloud"!
</p><p>
The public relations nightmare attached to that final permission.  For the
text did not say that you were not permitted to use the Read Aloud button;
it said you did not have the permission to read the book aloud. That led
some people to think that Adobe was restricting the right of parents, for
example, to read the book to their children, which seemed, to say the least,
absurd.
</p><p>
Adobe responded quickly that it was absurd to think that it was trying to
restrict the right to read a book aloud. Obviously it was only restricting
the ability to use the Read Aloud button to have the book read aloud. But
the question Adobe never did answer is this: Would Adobe thus agree that a
consumer was free to use software to hack around the restrictions built into
the eBook Reader? If some company (call it Elcomsoft) developed a program to
disable the technological protection built into an Adobe eBook so that a
blind person, say, could use a computer to read the book aloud, would Adobe
agree that such a use of an eBook Reader was fair? Adobe didn't answer
because the answer, however absurd it might seem, is no.
</p><p>
The point is not to blame Adobe. Indeed, Adobe is among the most innovative
companies developing strategies to balance open access to content with
incentives for companies to innovate. But Adobe's technology enables
control, and Adobe has an incentive to defend this control.  That incentive
is understandable, yet what it creates is often crazy.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2695685"></a><p>
To see the point in a particularly absurd context, consider a favorite story
of mine that makes the same point.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxaibo"></a><p>
Consider the robotic dog made by Sony named "Aibo." The Aibo learns tricks,
cuddles, and follows you around. It eats only electricity and that doesn't
leave that much of a mess (at least in your house).
</p><p>

The Aibo is expensive and popular. Fans from around the world have set up
clubs to trade stories. One fan in particular set up a Web site to enable
information about the Aibo dog to be shared. This fan set up aibopet.com
(and aibohack.com, but that resolves to the same site), and on that site he
provided information about how to teach an Aibo to do tricks in addition to
the ones Sony had taught it.
</p><p>
"Teach" here has a special meaning. Aibos are just cute computers.  You
teach a computer how to do something by programming it differently.  So to
say that aibopet.com was giving information about how to teach the dog to do
new tricks is just to say that aibopet.com was giving information to users
of the Aibo pet about how to hack their computer "dog" to make it do new
tricks (thus, aibohack.com).
</p><p>
If you're not a programmer or don't know many programmers, the word
<em class="citetitle">hack</em> has a particularly unfriendly
connotation. Nonprogrammers hack bushes or weeds. Nonprogrammers in horror
movies do even worse. But to programmers, or coders, as I call them,
<em class="citetitle">hack</em> is a much more positive
term. <em class="citetitle">Hack</em> just means code that enables the program
to do something it wasn't originally intended or enabled to do. If you buy a
new printer for an old computer, you might find the old computer doesn't
run, or "drive," the printer. If you discovered that, you'd later be happy
to discover a hack on the Net by someone who has written a driver to enable
the computer to drive the printer you just bought.
</p><p>
Some hacks are easy. Some are unbelievably hard. Hackers as a community like
to challenge themselves and others with increasingly difficult
tasks. There's a certain respect that goes with the talent to hack
well. There's a well-deserved respect that goes with the talent to hack
ethically.
</p><p>
The Aibo fan was displaying a bit of both when he hacked the program and
offered to the world a bit of code that would enable the Aibo to dance
jazz. The dog wasn't programmed to dance jazz. It was a clever bit of
tinkering that turned the dog into a more talented creature than Sony had
built.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2695788"></a><p>

I've told this story in many contexts, both inside and outside the United
States. Once I was asked by a puzzled member of the audience, is it
permissible for a dog to dance jazz in the United States? We forget that
stories about the backcountry still flow across much of the world. So let's
just be clear before we continue: It's not a crime anywhere (anymore) to
dance jazz. Nor is it a crime to teach your dog to dance jazz. Nor should it
be a crime (though we don't have a lot to go on here) to teach your robot
dog to dance jazz. Dancing jazz is a completely legal activity. One imagines
that the owner of aibopet.com thought, <span class="emphasis"><em>What possible problem could
there be with teaching a robot dog to dance?</em></span>
</p><p>
Let's put the dog to sleep for a minute, and turn to a pony show&#8212; not
literally a pony show, but rather a paper that a Princeton academic named Ed
Felten prepared for a conference. This Princeton academic is well known and
respected. He was hired by the government in the Microsoft case to test
Microsoft's claims about what could and could not be done with its own
code. In that trial, he demonstrated both his brilliance and his
coolness. Under heavy badgering by Microsoft lawyers, Ed Felten stood his
ground. He was not about to be bullied into being silent about something he
knew very well.
</p><p>
But Felten's bravery was really tested in April 2001.<sup>[<a name="id2695833" href="#ftn.id2695833" class="footnote">139</a>]</sup> He and a group of colleagues were working on a
paper to be submitted at conference.  The paper was intended to describe the
weakness in an encryption system being developed by the Secure Digital Music
Initiative as a technique to control the distribution of music.
</p><p>
The SDMI coalition had as its goal a technology to enable content owners to
exercise much better control over their content than the Internet, as it
originally stood, granted them. Using encryption, SDMI hoped to develop a
standard that would allow the content owner to say "this music cannot be
copied," and have a computer respect that command.  The technology was to be
part of a "trusted system" of control that would get content owners to trust
the system of the Internet much more.
</p><p>
When SDMI thought it was close to a standard, it set up a competition.  In
exchange for providing contestants with the code to an SDMI-encrypted bit of
content, contestants were to try to crack it and, if they did, report the
problems to the consortium.
</p><p>


Felten and his team figured out the encryption system quickly. He and the
team saw the weakness of this system as a type: Many encryption systems
would suffer the same weakness, and Felten and his team thought it
worthwhile to point this out to those who study encryption.
</p><p>
Let's review just what Felten was doing. Again, this is the United
States. We have a principle of free speech. We have this principle not just
because it is the law, but also because it is a really great idea. A
strongly protected tradition of free speech is likely to encourage a wide
range of criticism. That criticism is likely, in turn, to improve the
systems or people or ideas criticized.
</p><p>
What Felten and his colleagues were doing was publishing a paper describing
the weakness in a technology. They were not spreading free music, or
building and deploying this technology. The paper was an academic essay,
unintelligible to most people. But it clearly showed the weakness in the
SDMI system, and why SDMI would not, as presently constituted, succeed.
</p><p>
What links these two, aibopet.com and Felten, is the letters they then
received. Aibopet.com received a letter from Sony about the aibopet.com
hack. Though a jazz-dancing dog is perfectly legal, Sony wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Your site contains information providing the means to circumvent AIBO-ware's
copy protection protocol constituting a violation of the anti-circumvention
provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And though an academic paper describing the weakness in a system of
encryption should also be perfectly legal, Felten received a letter from an
RIAA lawyer that read:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

Any disclosure of information gained from participating in the Public
Challenge would be outside the scope of activities permitted by the
Agreement and could subject you and your research team to actions under the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In both cases, this weirdly Orwellian law was invoked to control the spread
of information. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act made spreading such
information an offense.
</p><p>
The DMCA was enacted as a response to copyright owners' first fear about
cyberspace. The fear was that copyright control was effectively dead; the
response was to find technologies that might compensate.  These new
technologies would be copyright protection technologies&#8212; technologies
to control the replication and distribution of copyrighted material. They
were designed as <span class="emphasis"><em>code</em></span> to modify the original
<span class="emphasis"><em>code</em></span> of the Internet, to reestablish some protection
for copyright owners.
</p><p>
The DMCA was a bit of law intended to back up the protection of this code
designed to protect copyrighted material. It was, we could say,
<span class="emphasis"><em>legal code</em></span> intended to buttress <span class="emphasis"><em>software
code</em></span> which itself was intended to support the <span class="emphasis"><em>legal
code of copyright</em></span>.
</p><p>
But the DMCA was not designed merely to protect copyrighted works to the
extent copyright law protected them. Its protection, that is, did not end at
the line that copyright law drew. The DMCA regulated devices that were
designed to circumvent copyright protection measures. It was designed to ban
those devices, whether or not the use of the copyrighted material made
possible by that circumvention would have been a copyright violation.
</p><p>

Aibopet.com and Felten make the point. The Aibo hack circumvented a
copyright protection system for the purpose of enabling the dog to dance
jazz. That enablement no doubt involved the use of copyrighted material. But
as aibopet.com's site was noncommercial, and the use did not enable
subsequent copyright infringements, there's no doubt that aibopet.com's hack
was fair use of Sony's copyrighted material. Yet fair use is not a defense
to the DMCA. The question is not whether the use of the copyrighted material
was a copyright violation. The question is whether a copyright protection
system was circumvented.
</p><p>
The threat against Felten was more attenuated, but it followed the same line
of reasoning. By publishing a paper describing how a copyright protection
system could be circumvented, the RIAA lawyer suggested, Felten himself was
distributing a circumvention technology.  Thus, even though he was not
himself infringing anyone's copyright, his academic paper was enabling
others to infringe others' copyright.
</p><p>
The bizarreness of these arguments is captured in a cartoon drawn in 1981 by
Paul Conrad. At that time, a court in California had held that the VCR could
be banned because it was a copyright-infringing technology: It enabled
consumers to copy films without the permission of the copyright owner. No
doubt there were uses of the technology that were legal: Fred Rogers, aka
"<em class="citetitle">Mr. Rogers</em>," for example, had testified in that case
that he wanted people to feel free to tape Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the
"Neighborhood" at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that it's
a real service to families to be able to record such programs and show them
at appropriate times. I have always felt that with the advent of all of this
new technology that allows people to tape the "Neighborhood" off-the-air,
and I'm speaking for the "Neighborhood" because that's what I produce, that
they then become much more active in the programming of their family's
television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by
others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been "You are an
important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions."
Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a
person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy
way, is important.<sup>[<a name="id2696082" href="#ftn.id2696082" class="footnote">140</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>


Even though there were uses that were legal, because there were some uses
that were illegal, the court held the companies producing the VCR
responsible.
</p><p>
This led Conrad to draw the cartoon below, which we can adopt to the DMCA.
</p><p>
No argument I have can top this picture, but let me try to get close.
</p><p>
The anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA target copyright circumvention
technologies. Circumvention technologies can be used for different
ends. They can be used, for example, to enable massive pirating of
copyrighted material&#8212;a bad end. Or they can be used to enable the use
of particular copyrighted materials in ways that would be considered fair
use&#8212;a good end.
</p><p>

A handgun can be used to shoot a police officer or a child. Most would agree
such a use is bad. Or a handgun can be used for target practice or to
protect against an intruder. At least some would say that such a use would
be good. It, too, is a technology that has both good and bad uses.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1711"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.18. VCR/handgun cartoon.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1711.png" alt="VCR/handgun cartoon."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
The obvious point of Conrad's cartoon is the weirdness of a world where guns
are legal, despite the harm they can do, while VCRs (and circumvention
technologies) are illegal. Flash: <span class="emphasis"><em>No one ever died from copyright
circumvention</em></span>. Yet the law bans circumvention technologies
absolutely, despite the potential that they might do some good, but permits
guns, despite the obvious and tragic harm they do.
</p><p>
The Aibo and RIAA examples demonstrate how copyright owners are changing the
balance that copyright law grants. Using code, copyright owners restrict
fair use; using the DMCA, they punish those who would attempt to evade the
restrictions on fair use that they impose through code. Technology becomes a
means by which fair use can be erased; the law of the DMCA backs up that
erasing.
</p><p>
This is how <span class="emphasis"><em>code</em></span> becomes <span class="emphasis"><em>law</em></span>. The
controls built into the technology of copy and access protection become
rules the violation of which is also a violation of the law. In this way,
the code extends the law&#8212;increasing its regulation, even if the
subject it regulates (activities that would otherwise plainly constitute
fair use) is beyond the reach of the law. Code becomes law; code extends the
law; code thus extends the control that copyright owners effect&#8212;at
least for those copyright holders with the lawyers who can write the nasty
letters that Felten and aibopet.com received.
</p><p>
There is one final aspect of the interaction between architecture and law
that contributes to the force of copyright's regulation. This is the ease
with which infringements of the law can be detected. For contrary to the
rhetoric common at the birth of cyberspace that on the Internet, no one
knows you're a dog, increasingly, given changing technologies deployed on
the Internet, it is easy to find the dog who committed a legal wrong. The
technologies of the Internet are open to snoops as well as sharers, and the
snoops are increasingly good at tracking down the identity of those who
violate the rules.
</p><p>


For example, imagine you were part of a <em class="citetitle">Star Trek</em> fan
club. You gathered every month to share trivia, and maybe to enact a kind of
fan fiction about the show. One person would play Spock, another, Captain
Kirk. The characters would begin with a plot from a real story, then simply
continue it.<sup>[<a name="id2696221" href="#ftn.id2696221" class="footnote">141</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Before the Internet, this was, in effect, a totally unregulated activity.
No matter what happened inside your club room, you would never be interfered
with by the copyright police. You were free in that space to do as you
wished with this part of our culture. You were allowed to build on it as you
wished without fear of legal control.
</p><p>
But if you moved your club onto the Internet, and made it generally
available for others to join, the story would be very different. Bots
scouring the Net for trademark and copyright infringement would quickly find
your site. Your posting of fan fiction, depending upon the ownership of the
series that you're depicting, could well inspire a lawyer's threat. And
ignoring the lawyer's threat would be extremely costly indeed.  The law of
copyright is extremely efficient. The penalties are severe, and the process
is quick.
</p><p>
This change in the effective force of the law is caused by a change in the
ease with which the law can be enforced. That change too shifts the law's
balance radically. It is as if your car transmitted the speed at which you
traveled at every moment that you drove; that would be just one step before
the state started issuing tickets based upon the data you transmitted. That
is, in effect, what is happening here.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Marked: Konsentrasjon"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="marketconcentration"></a>Marked: Konsentrasjon</h2></div></div></div><p>

So copyright's duration has increased dramatically&#8212;tripled in the past
thirty years. And copyright's scope has increased as well&#8212;from
regulating only publishers to now regulating just about everyone. And
copyright's reach has changed, as every action becomes a copy and hence
presumptively regulated. And as technologists find better ways to control
the use of content, and as copyright is increasingly enforced through
technology, copyright's force changes, too. Misuse is easier to find and
easier to control. This regulation of the creative process, which began as a
tiny regulation governing a tiny part of the market for creative work, has
become the single most important regulator of creativity there is. It is a
massive expansion in the scope of the government's control over innovation
and creativity; it would be totally unrecognizable to those who gave birth
to copyright's control.
</p><p>
Still, in my view, all of these changes would not matter much if it weren't
for one more change that we must also consider. This is a change that is in
some sense the most familiar, though its significance and scope are not well
understood. It is the one that creates precisely the reason to be concerned
about all the other changes I have described.
</p><p>
This is the change in the concentration and integration of the media.  In
the past twenty years, the nature of media ownership has undergone a radical
alteration, caused by changes in legal rules governing the media.  Before
this change happened, the different forms of media were owned by separate
media companies. Now, the media is increasingly owned by only a few
companies. Indeed, after the changes that the FCC announced in June 2003,
most expect that within a few years, we will live in a world where just
three companies control more than percent of the media.
</p><p>
Det er her to sorter endringer: omfanget av konsentrasjon, og dens natur.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2696325"></a><p>
Changes in scope are the easier ones to describe. As Senator John McCain
summarized the data produced in the FCC's review of media ownership, "five
companies control 85 percent of our media sources."<sup>[<a name="id2696336" href="#ftn.id2696336" class="footnote">142</a>]</sup> The five recording labels of Universal Music Group,
BMG, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and EMI control 84.8
percent of the U.S. music market.<sup>[<a name="id2696348" href="#ftn.id2696348" class="footnote">143</a>]</sup> The
"five largest cable companies pipe programming to 74 percent of the cable
subscribers nationwide."<sup>[<a name="id2696361" href="#ftn.id2696361" class="footnote">144</a>]</sup> <a class="indexterm" name="id2696372"></a>
</p><p>

The story with radio is even more dramatic. Before deregulation, the
nation's largest radio broadcasting conglomerate owned fewer than
seventy-five stations. Today <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> company owns more than
1,200 stations.  During that period of consolidation, the total number of
radio owners dropped by 34 percent. Today, in most markets, the two largest
broadcasters control 74 percent of that market's revenues. Overall, just
four companies control 90 percent of the nation's radio advertising
revenues.
</p><p>
Newspaper ownership is becoming more concentrated as well.  Today, there are
six hundred fewer daily newspapers in the United States than there were
eighty years ago, and ten companies control half of the nation's
circulation. There are twenty major newspaper publishers in the United
States. The top ten film studios receive 99 percent of all film revenue. The
ten largest cable companies account for 85 percent of all cable
revenue. This is a market far from the free press the framers sought to
protect. Indeed, it is a market that is quite well protected&#8212; by the
market.
</p><p>
Concentration in size alone is one thing. The more invidious change is in
the nature of that concentration. As author James Fallows put it in a recent
article about Rupert Murdoch, <a class="indexterm" name="id2696413"></a>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Murdoch's companies now constitute a production system unmatched in its
integration. They supply content&#8212;Fox movies . . .  Fox TV shows
. . . Fox-controlled sports broadcasts, plus newspapers and books. They sell
the content to the public and to advertisers&#8212;in newspapers, on the
broadcast network, on the cable channels. And they operate the physical
distribution system through which the content reaches the
customers. Murdoch's satellite systems now distribute News Corp. content in
Europe and Asia; if Murdoch becomes DirecTV's largest single owner, that
system will serve the same function in the United States.<sup>[<a name="id2696428" href="#ftn.id2696428" class="footnote">145</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The pattern with Murdoch is the pattern of modern media. Not just large
companies owning many radio stations, but a few companies owning as many
outlets of media as possible. A picture describes this pattern better than a
thousand words could do:
</p><div class="figure"><a name="fig-1761"></a><p class="title"><b>Figur 11.19. Mønster for moderne mediaeierskap.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/1761.png" alt="Mønster for moderne mediaeierskap."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>


Betyr denne konsentrasjonen noe?  Påvirker det hva som blir laget, eller hva
som blir distribuert?  Eller er det bare en mer effektiv måte å produsere og
distribuere innhold?
</p><p>
Mitt syn var at konsentrasjonen ikke betød noe.  Jeg tenkte det ikke var noe
mer enn en mer effektiv finansiell struktur.  Men nå, etter å ha lest og
hørt på en haug av skapere prøve å overbevise meg om det motsatte, har jeg
begynt å endre mening.
</p><p>
Her er en representativ historie som kan foreslå hvorfor denne integreringen
er viktig.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2696508"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2696514"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2696520"></a><p>
I 1969 laget Norman Lear en polit for <em class="citetitle">All in the
Family</em>.  Han tok piloten til ABC, og nettverket likte det ikke.
Da sa til Lear at det var for på kanten.  Gjør det om igjen. Lear lagde
piloten på nytt, mer på kanten enn den første.  ABC ble fra seg.  Du får
ikke med deg poenget, fortalte de Lear.  Vi vil ha det mindre på kanten,
ikke mer.
</p><p>
I stedet for å føye seg, to Lear ganske enkelt serien sin til noen andre.
CBS var glad for å ha seriene, og ABC kunne ikke stoppe Lear fra å gå til
andre.  Opphavsretten som Lear hadde sikret uavhengighet fra
nettverk-kontroll.<sup>[<a name="id2696554" href="#ftn.id2696554" class="footnote">146</a>]</sup>
</p><p>



The network did not control those copyrights because the law forbade the
networks from controlling the content they syndicated. The law required a
separation between the networks and the content producers; that separation
would guarantee Lear freedom. And as late as 1992, because of these rules,
the vast majority of prime time television&#8212;75 percent of it&#8212;was
"independent" of the networks.
</p><p>
In 1994, the FCC abandoned the rules that required this independence.  After
that change, the networks quickly changed the balance.  In 1985, there were
twenty-five independent television production studios; in 2002, only five
independent television studios remained. "In 1992, only 15 percent of new
series were produced for a network by a company it controlled. Last year,
the percentage of shows produced by controlled companies more than
quintupled to 77 percent." "In 1992, 16 new series were produced
independently of conglomerate control, last year there was one."<sup>[<a name="id2696590" href="#ftn.id2696590" class="footnote">147</a>]</sup> In 2002, 75 percent of prime time television was
owned by the networks that ran it. "In the ten-year period between 1992 and
2002, the number of prime time television hours per week produced by network
studios increased over 200%, whereas the number of prime time television
hours per week produced by independent studios decreased 63%."<sup>[<a name="id2696626" href="#ftn.id2696626" class="footnote">148</a>]</sup>
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2696634"></a><p>
Today, another Norman Lear with another <em class="citetitle">All in the
Family</em> would find that he had the choice either to make the show
less edgy or to be fired: The content of any show developed for a network is
increasingly owned by the network.
</p><p>
While the number of channels has increased dramatically, the ownership of
those channels has narrowed to an ever smaller and smaller few. As Barry
Diller said to Bill Moyers, <a class="indexterm" name="id2696656"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2696662"></a>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Well, if you have companies that produce, that finance, that air on their
channel and then distribute worldwide everything that goes through their
controlled distribution system, then what you get is fewer and fewer actual
voices participating in the process. [We u]sed to have dozens and dozens of
thriving independent production companies producing television programs. Now
you have less than a handful.<sup>[<a name="id2696680" href="#ftn.id2696680" class="footnote">149</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This narrowing has an effect on what is produced. The product of such large
and concentrated networks is increasingly homogenous.  Increasingly
safe. Increasingly sterile. The product of news shows from networks like
this is increasingly tailored to the message the network wants to
convey. This is not the communist party, though from the inside, it must
feel a bit like the communist party. No one can question without risk of
consequence&#8212;not necessarily banishment to Siberia, but punishment
nonetheless. Independent, critical, different views are quashed. This is not
the environment for a democracy.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2696704"></a><p>
Economics itself offers a parallel that explains why this integration
affects creativity. Clay Christensen has written about the "Innovator's
Dilemma": the fact that large traditional firms find it rational to ignore
new, breakthrough technologies that compete with their core business.  The
same analysis could help explain why large, traditional media companies
would find it rational to ignore new cultural trends.<sup>[<a name="id2696739" href="#ftn.id2696739" class="footnote">150</a>]</sup> Lumbering giants not only don't, but should not,
sprint. Yet if the field is only open to the giants, there will be far too
little sprinting.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2696768"></a>
</p><p>
I don't think we know enough about the economics of the media market to say
with certainty what concentration and integration will do. The efficiencies
are important, and the effect on culture is hard to measure.
</p><p>
But there is a quintessentially obvious example that does strongly suggest
the concern.
</p><p>
In addition to the copyright wars, we're in the middle of the drug
wars. Government policy is strongly directed against the drug cartels;
criminal and civil courts are filled with the consequences of this battle.
</p><p>

Let me hereby disqualify myself from any possible appointment to any
position in government by saying I believe this war is a profound mistake. I
am not pro drugs. Indeed, I come from a family once wrecked by
drugs&#8212;though the drugs that wrecked my family were all quite legal. I
believe this war is a profound mistake because the collateral damage from it
is so great as to make waging the war insane.  When you add together the
burdens on the criminal justice system, the desperation of generations of
kids whose only real economic opportunities are as drug warriors, the
queering of constitutional protections because of the constant surveillance
this war requires, and, most profoundly, the total destruction of the legal
systems of many South American nations because of the power of the local
drug cartels, I find it impossible to believe that the marginal benefit in
reduced drug consumption by Americans could possibly outweigh these costs.
</p><p>
You may not be convinced. That's fine. We live in a democracy, and it is
through votes that we are to choose policy. But to do that, we depend
fundamentally upon the press to help inform Americans about these issues.
</p><p>
Beginning in 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy launched a
media campaign as part of the "war on drugs." The campaign produced scores
of short film clips about issues related to illegal drugs. In one series
(the Nick and Norm series) two men are in a bar, discussing the idea of
legalizing drugs as a way to avoid some of the collateral damage from the
war. One advances an argument in favor of drug legalization. The other
responds in a powerful and effective way against the argument of the
first. In the end, the first guy changes his mind (hey, it's
television). The plug at the end is a damning attack on the pro-legalization
campaign.
</p><p>
Fair enough. It's a good ad. Not terribly misleading. It delivers its
message well. It's a fair and reasonable message.
</p><p>
But let's say you think it is a wrong message, and you'd like to run a
countercommercial. Say you want to run a series of ads that try to
demonstrate the extraordinary collateral harm that comes from the drug
war. Can you do it?
</p><p>

Well, obviously, these ads cost lots of money. Assume you raise the
money. Assume a group of concerned citizens donates all the money in the
world to help you get your message out. Can you be sure your message will be
heard then?
</p><p>
No. You cannot. Television stations have a general policy of avoiding
"controversial" ads. Ads sponsored by the government are deemed
uncontroversial; ads disagreeing with the government are controversial.
This selectivity might be thought inconsistent with the First Amendment, but
the Supreme Court has held that stations have the right to choose what they
run. Thus, the major channels of commercial media will refuse one side of a
crucial debate the opportunity to present its case.  And the courts will
defend the rights of the stations to be this biased.<sup>[<a name="id2696870" href="#ftn.id2696870" class="footnote">151</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
I'd be happy to defend the networks' rights, as well&#8212;if we lived in a
media market that was truly diverse. But concentration in the media throws
that condition into doubt. If a handful of companies control access to the
media, and that handful of companies gets to decide which political
positions it will allow to be promoted on its channels, then in an obvious
and important way, concentration matters. You might like the positions the
handful of companies selects. But you should not like a world in which a
mere few get to decide which issues the rest of us get to know about.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Sammen"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="together"></a>Sammen</h2></div></div></div><p>
There is something innocent and obvious about the claim of the copyright
warriors that the government should "protect my property." In the abstract,
it is obviously true and, ordinarily, totally harmless. No sane sort who is
not an anarchist could disagree.
</p><p>

But when we see how dramatically this "property" has changed&#8212; when we
recognize how it might now interact with both technology and markets to mean
that the effective constraint on the liberty to cultivate our culture is
dramatically different&#8212;the claim begins to seem less innocent and
obvious. Given (1) the power of technology to supplement the law's control,
and (2) the power of concentrated markets to weaken the opportunity for
dissent, if strictly enforcing the massively expanded "property" rights
granted by copyright fundamentally changes the freedom within this culture
to cultivate and build upon our past, then we have to ask whether this
property should be redefined.
</p><p>
Not starkly. Or absolutely. My point is not that we should abolish copyright
or go back to the eighteenth century. That would be a total mistake,
disastrous for the most important creative enterprises within our culture
today.
</p><p>
But there is a space between zero and one, Internet culture
notwithstanding.  And these massive shifts in the effective power of
copyright regulation, tied to increased concentration of the content
industry and resting in the hands of technology that will increasingly
enable control over the use of culture, should drive us to consider whether
another adjustment is called for. Not an adjustment that increases
copyright's power. Not an adjustment that increases its term. Rather, an
adjustment to restore the balance that has traditionally defined copyright's
regulation&#8212;a weakening of that regulation, to strengthen creativity.
</p><p>
Copyright law has not been a rock of Gibraltar. It's not a set of constant
commitments that, for some mysterious reason, teenagers and geeks now
flout. Instead, copyright power has grown dramatically in a short period of
time, as the technologies of distribution and creation have changed and as
lobbyists have pushed for more control by copyright holders. Changes in the
past in response to changes in technology suggest that we may well need
similar changes in the future. And these changes have to be
<span class="emphasis"><em>reductions</em></span> in the scope of copyright, in response to
the extraordinary increase in control that technology and the market enable.
</p><p>

For the single point that is lost in this war on pirates is a point that we
see only after surveying the range of these changes. When you add together
the effect of changing law, concentrated markets, and changing technology,
together they produce an astonishing conclusion: <span class="emphasis"><em>Never in our
history have fewer had a legal right to control more of the development of
our culture than now</em></span>.
</p><p>
Not when copyrights were perpetual, for when copyrights were perpetual, they
affected only that precise creative work. Not when only publishers had the
tools to publish, for the market then was much more diverse. Not when there
were only three television networks, for even then, newspapers, film
studios, radio stations, and publishers were independent of the
networks. <span class="emphasis"><em>Never</em></span> has copyright protected such a wide
range of rights, against as broad a range of actors, for a term that was
remotely as long. This form of regulation&#8212;a tiny regulation of a tiny
part of the creative energy of a nation at the founding&#8212;is now a
massive regulation of the overall creative process. Law plus technology plus
the market now interact to turn this historically benign regulation into the
most significant regulation of culture that our free society has
known.<sup>[<a name="id2697074" href="#ftn.id2697074" class="footnote">152</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
This has been a long chapter. Its point can now be briefly stated.
</p><p>
At the start of this book, I distinguished between commercial and
noncommercial culture. In the course of this chapter, I have distinguished
between copying a work and transforming it. We can now combine these two
distinctions and draw a clear map of the changes that copyright law has
undergone.  In 1790, the law looked like this:
</p><div class="table"><a name="t2"></a><p class="title"><b>Tabell 11.1. Law status in 1790</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Law status in 1790" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="char"> </th><th align="char">Publiser</th><th align="char">TRANSFORM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char">Kommersiell</td><td align="char">©</td><td align="char">Fri</td></tr><tr><td align="char">Ikke-kommersiell</td><td align="char">Fri</td><td align="char">Fri</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"><p>

The act of publishing a map, chart, and book was regulated by copyright
law. Nothing else was. Transformations were free. And as copyright attached
only with registration, and only those who intended to benefit commercially
would register, copying through publishing of noncommercial work was also
free.
</p><p>
By the end of the nineteenth century, the law had changed to this:
</p><div class="table"><a name="t3"></a><p class="title"><b>Tabell 11.2. Law status at the end of ninetheenth centory</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Law status at the end of ninetheenth centory" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="char"> </th><th align="char">Publiser</th><th align="char">TRANSFORM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char">Kommersiell</td><td align="char">©</td><td align="char">©</td></tr><tr><td align="char">Ikke-kommersiell</td><td align="char">Fri</td><td align="char">Fri</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"><p>
Derivative works were now regulated by copyright law&#8212;if published,
which again, given the economics of publishing at the time, means if offered
commercially. But noncommercial publishing and transformation were still
essentially free.
</p><p>
In 1909 the law changed to regulate copies, not publishing, and after this
change, the scope of the law was tied to technology. As the technology of
copying became more prevalent, the reach of the law expanded.  Thus by 1975,
as photocopying machines became more common, we could say the law began to
look like this:
</p><div class="table"><a name="t4"></a><p class="title"><b>Tabell 11.3. Law status in 1975</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Law status in 1975" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="char"> </th><th align="char">Kopier</th><th align="char">TRANSFORM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char">Kommersiell</td><td align="char">©</td><td align="char">©</td></tr><tr><td align="char">Ikke-kommersiell</td><td align="char">©/Fri</td><td align="char">Fri</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"><p>
The law was interpreted to reach noncommercial copying through, say, copy
machines, but still much of copying outside of the commercial market
remained free. But the consequence of the emergence of digital technologies,
especially in the context of a digital network, means that the law now looks
like this:
</p><div class="table"><a name="t5"></a><p class="title"><b>Tabell 11.4. Law status now</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Law status now" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="char"> </th><th align="char">Kopier</th><th align="char">TRANSFORM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char">Kommersiell</td><td align="char">©</td><td align="char">©</td></tr><tr><td align="char">Ikke-kommersiell</td><td align="char">©</td><td align="char">©</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"><p>

Every realm is governed by copyright law, whereas before most creativity was
not. The law now regulates the full range of creativity&#8212; commercial or
not, transformative or not&#8212;with the same rules designed to regulate
commercial publishers.
</p><p>
Obviously, copyright law is not the enemy. The enemy is regulation that does
no good. So the question that we should be asking just now is whether
extending the regulations of copyright law into each of these domains
actually does any good.
</p><p>
I have no doubt that it does good in regulating commercial copying.  But I
also have no doubt that it does more harm than good when regulating (as it
regulates just now) noncommercial copying and, especially, noncommercial
transformation. And increasingly, for the reasons sketched especially in
chapters <a class="xref" href="#recorders" title="Kapittel 8. Kapittel sju: Innspillerne">8</a> and
<a class="xref" href="#transformers" title="Kapittel 9. Kapittel åtte: Omformere">9</a>, one might
well wonder whether it does more harm than good for commercial
transformation.  More commercial transformative work would be created if
derivative rights were more sharply restricted.
</p><p>
The issue is therefore not simply whether copyright is property. Of course
copyright is a kind of "property," and of course, as with any property, the
state ought to protect it. But first impressions notwithstanding,
historically, this property right (as with all property rights<sup>[<a name="id2697442" href="#ftn.id2697442" class="footnote">153</a>]</sup>)  has been crafted to balance the important need to
give authors and artists incentives with the equally important need to
assure access to creative work. This balance has always been struck in light
of new technologies.  And for almost half of our tradition, the "copyright"
did not control <span class="emphasis"><em>at all</em></span> the freedom of others to build
upon or transform a creative work. American culture was born free, and for
almost 180 years our country consistently protected a vibrant and rich free
culture.
</p><p>

We achieved that free culture because our law respected important limits on
the scope of the interests protected by "property." The very birth of
"copyright" as a statutory right recognized those limits, by granting
copyright owners protection for a limited time only (the story of chapter
6). The tradition of "fair use" is animated by a similar concern that is
increasingly under strain as the costs of exercising any fair use right
become unavoidably high (the story of chapter 7). Adding statutory rights
where markets might stifle innovation is another familiar limit on the
property right that copyright is (chapter 8). And granting archives and
libraries a broad freedom to collect, claims of property notwithstanding, is
a crucial part of guaranteeing the soul of a culture (chapter 9). Free
cultures, like free markets, are built with property. But the nature of the
property that builds a free culture is very different from the extremist
vision that dominates the debate today.
</p><p>
Free culture is increasingly the casualty in this war on piracy. In response
to a real, if not yet quantified, threat that the technologies of the
Internet present to twentieth-century business models for producing and
distributing culture, the law and technology are being transformed in a way
that will undermine our tradition of free culture. The property right that
is copyright is no longer the balanced right that it was, or was intended to
be. The property right that is copyright has become unbalanced, tilted
toward an extreme. The opportunity to create and transform becomes weakened
in a world in which creation requires permission and creativity must check
with a lawyer.

Lawyers speak of "property" not as an absolute thing, but as a bundle of
rights that are sometimes associated with a particular object. Thus, my
"property right" to my car gives me the right to exclusive use, but not the
right to drive at 150 miles an hour. For the best effort to connect the
ordinary meaning of "property" to "lawyer talk," see Bruce Ackerman,
<em class="citetitle">Private Property and the Constitution</em> (New Haven:
Yale University Press, 1977), 26&#8211;27.

By describing the way law affects the other three modalities, I don't mean
to suggest that the other three don't affect law. Obviously, they do. Law's
only distinction is that it alone speaks as if it has a right
self-consciously to change the other three. The right of the other three is
more timidly expressed.  See Lawrence Lessig, <em class="citetitle">Code: And Other
Laws of Cyberspace</em> (New York: Basic Books, 1999): 90&#8211;95;

Some people object to this way of talking about "liberty." They object
because their focus when considering the constraints that exist at any
particular moment are constraints imposed exclusively by the government. For
instance, if a storm destroys a bridge, these people think it is meaningless
to say that one's liberty has been restrained. A bridge has washed out, and
it's harder to get from one place to another. To talk about this as a loss
of freedom, they say, is to confuse the stuff of politics with the vagaries
of ordinary life.  I don't mean to deny the value in this narrower view,
which depends upon the context of the inquiry. I do, however, mean to argue
against any insistence that this narrower view is the only proper view of
liberty. As I argued in <em class="citetitle">Code</em>, we come from a long
tradition of political thought with a broader focus than the narrow question
of what the government did when.  John Stuart Mill defended freedom of
speech, for example, from the tyranny of narrow minds, not from the fear of
government prosecution; John Stuart Mill, <em class="citetitle">On Liberty</em>
(Indiana: Hackett Publishing Co., 1978), 19.  John R. Commons famously
defended the economic freedom of labor from constraints imposed by the
market; John R. Commons, "The Right to Work," in Malcom Rutherford and
Warren J. Samuels, eds., <em class="citetitle">John R. Commons: Selected
Essays</em> (London: Routledge: 1997), 62. The Americans with
Disabilities Act increases the liberty of people with physical disabilities
by changing the architecture of certain public places, thereby making access
to those places easier; 42 <em class="citetitle">United States Code</em>,
section 12101 (2000).  Each of these interventions to change existing
conditions changes the liberty of a particular group. The effect of those
interventions should be accounted for in order to understand the effective
liberty that each of these groups might face.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2693491"></a>

overwhelming majority of works fell immediately into the public domain. Even
those works that were copyrighted fell into the public domain quickly,
because the term of copyright was short. The initial term of copyright was
fourteen years, with the option of renewal for an additional fourteen
years. Copyright Act of May 31, 1790, §1, 1 stat. 124.  </p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id2694215" href="#id2694215" class="para">127</a>] </sup>


Few copyright holders ever chose to renew their copyrights. For instance, of
the 25,006 copyrights registered in 1883, only 894 were renewed in 1910. For

Professor Rubenfeld has presented a powerful constitutional argument about
the difference that copyright law should draw (from the perspective of the
First Amendment) between mere "copies" and derivative works. See Jed
Rubenfeld, "The Freedom of Imagination: Copyright's Constitutionality,"
<em class="citetitle">Yale Law Journal</em> 112 (2002): 1&#8211;60 (see
especially pp. 53&#8211;59).

This is a simplification of the law, but not much of one. The law certainly
regulates more than "copies"&#8212;a public performance of a copyrighted
song, for example, is regulated even though performance per se doesn't make
a copy; 17 <em class="citetitle">United States Code</em>, section 106(4). And it
certainly sometimes doesn't regulate a "copy"; 17 <em class="citetitle">United States
Code</em>, section 112(a). But the presumption under the existing law
(which regulates "copies;" 17 <em class="citetitle">United States Code</em>,
section 102) is that if there is a copy, there is a right.
</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id2694713" href="#id2694713" class="para">134</a>] </sup>


Thus, my argument is not that in each place that copyright law extends, we
should repeal it. It is instead that we should have a good argument for its
extending where it does, and should not determine its reach on the basis of
arbitrary and automatic changes caused by technology.

I don't mean "nature" in the sense that it couldn't be different, but rather

remain.

example, buy a book from you that includes a contract that says I will read

The Marijuana Policy Project, in February 2003, sought to place ads that
directly responded to the Nick and Norm series on stations within the
Washington, D.C., area. Comcast rejected the ads as "against [their]

them. The local ABC affiliate, WJOA, originally agreed to run the ads and
accepted payment to do so, but later decided not to run the ads and returned
the collected fees. Interview with Neal Levine, 15 October 2003.  These
restrictions are, of course, not limited to drug policy. See, for example,

In a well-known short story by H. G. Wells, a mountain climber named Nunez
trips (literally, down an ice slope) into an unknown and isolated valley in
the Peruvian Andes.<sup>[<a name="id2697572" href="#ftn.id2697572" class="footnote">154</a>]</sup> The valley is
extraordinarily beautiful, with "sweet water, pasture, an even climate,
slopes of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent
fruit." But the villagers are all blind. Nunez takes this as an
opportunity. "In the Country of the Blind," he tells himself, "the One-Eyed
Man is King." So he resolves to live with the villagers to explore life as a
king.
</p><p>
Things don't go quite as he planned. He tries to explain the idea of sight
to the villagers. They don't understand. He tells them they are "blind."
They don't have the word <em class="citetitle">blind</em>. They think he's just
thick.  Indeed, as they increasingly notice the things he can't do (hear the
sound of grass being stepped on, for example), they increasingly try to
control him. He, in turn, becomes increasingly frustrated. "`You don't
understand,' he cried, in a voice that was meant to be great and resolute,
and which broke. `You are blind and I can see. Leave me alone!'"
</p><p>


The villagers don't leave him alone. Nor do they see (so to speak) the
virtue of his special power. Not even the ultimate target of his affection,
a young woman who to him seems "the most beautiful thing in the whole of
creation," understands the beauty of sight. Nunez's description of what he
sees "seemed to her the most poetical of fancies, and she listened to his
description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet white-lit
beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence." "She did not believe," Wells
tells us, and "she could only half understand, but she was mysteriously
delighted."
</p><p>
When Nunez announces his desire to marry his "mysteriously delighted" love,
the father and the village object. "You see, my dear," her father instructs,
"he's an idiot. He has delusions. He can't do anything right." They take
Nunez to the village doctor.
</p><p>
After a careful examination, the doctor gives his opinion. "His brain is
affected," he reports.
</p><p>
"What affects it?" the father asks.  "Those queer things that are called the
eyes . . . are diseased . . . in such a way as to affect his brain."
</p><p>
The doctor continues: "I think I may say with reasonable certainty that in
order to cure him completely, all that we need to do is a simple and easy
surgical operation&#8212;namely, to remove these irritant bodies [the
eyes]."
</p><p>

"Thank Heaven for science!" says the father to the doctor. They inform Nunez
of this condition necessary for him to be allowed his bride.  (You'll have
to read the original to learn what happens in the end. I believe in free
culture, but never in giving away the end of a story.)  It sometimes happens
that the eggs of twins fuse in the mother's womb. That fusion produces a
"chimera." A chimera is a single creature with two sets of DNA. The DNA in
the blood, for example, might be different from the DNA of the skin. This
possibility is an underused plot for murder mysteries. "But the DNA shows
with 100 percent certainty that she was not the person whose blood was at
the scene. . . ."
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2697668"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2697676"></a><p>
Before I had read about chimeras, I would have said they were impossible.  A
single person can't have two sets of DNA. The very idea of DNA is that it is
the code of an individual. Yet in fact, not only can two individuals have
the same set of DNA (identical twins), but one person can have two different
sets of DNA (a chimera). Our understanding of a "person" should reflect this
reality.
</p><p>
The more I work to understand the current struggle over copyright and
culture, which I've sometimes called unfairly, and sometimes not unfairly
enough, "the copyright wars," the more I think we're dealing with a
chimera. For example, in the battle over the question "What is p2p file
sharing?" both sides have it right, and both sides have it wrong.  One side
says, "File sharing is just like two kids taping each others'
records&#8212;the sort of thing we've been doing for the last thirty years
without any question at all." That's true, at least in part. When I tell my
best friend to try out a new CD that I've bought, but rather than just send
the CD, I point him to my p2p server, that is, in all relevant respects,
just like what every executive in every recording company no doubt did as a
kid: sharing music.
</p><p>
But the description is also false in part. For when my p2p server is on a
p2p network through which anyone can get access to my music, then sure, my
friends can get access, but it stretches the meaning of "friends" beyond
recognition to say "my ten thousand best friends" can get access. Whether or
not sharing my music with my best friend is what "we have always been
allowed to do," we have not always been allowed to share music with "our ten
thousand best friends."
</p><p>
Likewise, when the other side says, "File sharing is just like walking into
a Tower Records and taking a CD off the shelf and walking out with it,"
that's true, at least in part. If, after Lyle Lovett (finally) releases a
new album, rather than buying it, I go to Kazaa and find a free copy to
take, that is very much like stealing a copy from Tower.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2697731"></a>
</p><p>



But it is not quite stealing from Tower. After all, when I take a CD from
Tower Records, Tower has one less CD to sell. And when I take a CD from
Tower Records, I get a bit of plastic and a cover, and something to show on
my shelves. (And, while we're at it, we could also note that when I take a
CD from Tower Records, the maximum fine that might be imposed on me, under
California law, at least, is $1,000.  According to the RIAA, by contrast, if
I download a ten-song CD, I'm liable for $1,500,000 in damages.)
</p><p>
The point is not that it is as neither side describes. The point is that it
is both&#8212;both as the RIAA describes it and as Kazaa describes it. It is
a chimera. And rather than simply denying what the other side asserts, we
need to begin to think about how we should respond to this chimera. What
rules should govern it?
</p><p>
We could respond by simply pretending that it is not a chimera. We could,
with the RIAA, decide that every act of file sharing should be a felony. We
could prosecute families for millions of dollars in damages just because
file sharing occurred on a family computer. And we can get universities to
monitor all computer traffic to make sure that no computer is used to commit
this crime. These responses might be extreme, but each of them has either
been proposed or actually implemented.<sup>[<a name="id2697772" href="#ftn.id2697772" class="footnote">155</a>]</sup>

</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2697849"></a><p>
Alternatively, we could respond to file sharing the way many kids act as
though we've responded. We could totally legalize it. Let there be no
copyright liability, either civil or criminal, for making copyrighted
content available on the Net. Make file sharing like gossip: regulated, if
at all, by social norms but not by law.
</p><p>
Either response is possible. I think either would be a mistake.  Rather than
embrace one of these two extremes, we should embrace something that
recognizes the truth in both. And while I end this book with a sketch of a
system that does just that, my aim in the next chapter is to show just how
awful it would be for us to adopt the zero-tolerance extreme. I believe
<span class="emphasis"><em>either</em></span> extreme would be worse than a reasonable
alternative.  But I believe the zero-tolerance solution would be the worse
of the two extremes.
</p><p>



Yet zero tolerance is increasingly our government's policy. In the middle of
the chaos that the Internet has created, an extraordinary land grab is
occurring. The law and technology are being shifted to give content holders
a kind of control over our culture that they have never had before. And in
this extremism, many an opportunity for new innovation and new creativity
will be lost.
</p><p>
I'm not talking about the opportunities for kids to "steal" music. My focus
instead is the commercial and cultural innovation that this war will also
kill. We have never seen the power to innovate spread so broadly among our
citizens, and we have just begun to see the innovation that this power will
unleash. Yet the Internet has already seen the passing of one cycle of
innovation around technologies to distribute content. The law is responsible
for this passing. As the vice president for global public policy at one of
these new innovators, eMusic.com, put it when criticizing the DMCA's added
protection for copyrighted material,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
eMusic opposes music piracy. We are a distributor of copyrighted material,
and we want to protect those rights.
</p><p>
But building a technology fortress that locks in the clout of the major
labels is by no means the only way to protect copyright interests, nor is it
necessarily the best. It is simply too early to answer that question. Market
forces operating naturally may very well produce a totally different
industry model.
</p><p>
This is a critical point. The choices that industry sectors make with
respect to these systems will in many ways directly shape the market for
digital media and the manner in which digital media are distributed. This in
turn will directly influence the options that are available to consumers,
both in terms of the ease with which they will be able to access digital
media and the equipment that they will require to do so. Poor choices made
this early in the game will retard the growth of this market, hurting
everyone's interests.<sup>[<a name="id2697934" href="#ftn.id2697934" class="footnote">156</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In April 2001, eMusic.com was purchased by Vivendi Universal, one of "the
major labels." Its position on these matters has now changed.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2697957"></a>
</p><p>
Reversing our tradition of tolerance now will not merely quash piracy. It
will sacrifice values that are important to this culture, and will kill
opportunities that could be extraordinarily valuable.

To fight "piracy," to protect "property," the content industry has launched
a war. Lobbying and lots of campaign contributions have now brought the
government into this war. As with any war, this one will have both direct
and collateral damage. As with any war of prohibition, these damages will be
suffered most by our own people.
</p><p>
My aim so far has been to describe the consequences of this war, in
particular, the consequences for "free culture." But my aim now is to extend
this description of consequences into an argument. Is this war justified?
</p><p>
In my view, it is not. There is no good reason why this time, for the first
time, the law should defend the old against the new, just when the power of
the property called "intellectual property" is at its greatest in our
history.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2698005"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2698011"></a><p>
Yet "common sense" does not see it this way. Common sense is still on the
side of the Causbys and the content industry. The extreme claims of control
in the name of property still resonate; the uncritical rejection of "piracy"
still has play.
</p><p>


There will be many consequences of continuing this war. I want to describe
just three. All three might be said to be unintended. I am quite confident
the third is unintended. I'm less sure about the first two. The first two
protect modern RCAs, but there is no Howard Armstrong in the wings to fight
today's monopolists of culture.
</p><div class="section" title="Constraining Creators"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="constrain"></a>Constraining Creators</h2></div></div></div><p>
In the next ten years we will see an explosion of digital technologies.
These technologies will enable almost anyone to capture and share
content. Capturing and sharing content, of course, is what humans have done
since the dawn of man. It is how we learn and communicate. But capturing and
sharing through digital technology is different. The fidelity and power are
different. You could send an e-mail telling someone about a joke you saw on
Comedy Central, or you could send the clip. You could write an essay about
the inconsistencies in the arguments of the politician you most love to
hate, or you could make a short film that puts statement against
statement. You could write a poem to express your love, or you could weave
together a string&#8212;a mash-up&#8212; of songs from your favorite artists
in a collage and make it available on the Net.
</p><p>
This digital "capturing and sharing" is in part an extension of the
capturing and sharing that has always been integral to our culture, and in
part it is something new. It is continuous with the Kodak, but it explodes
the boundaries of Kodak-like technologies. The technology of digital
"capturing and sharing" promises a world of extraordinarily diverse
creativity that can be easily and broadly shared. And as that creativity is
applied to democracy, it will enable a broad range of citizens to use
technology to express and criticize and contribute to the culture all
around.
</p><p>

Teknologien har dermed gitt oss en mulighet til å gjøre noe med kultur som
bare har vært mulig for enkeltpersoner i små grupper, isolert fra andre
grupper. Forestill deg en gammel mann som forteller en historie til en
samling med naboer i en liten landsby.  Forestill deg så den samme
historiefortellingen utvidet til å nå over hele verden.
</p><p>
Yet all this is possible only if the activity is presumptively legal. In the
current regime of legal regulation, it is not. Forget file sharing for a
moment. Think about your favorite amazing sites on the Net. Web sites that
offer plot summaries from forgotten television shows; sites that catalog
cartoons from the 1960s; sites that mix images and sound to criticize
politicians or businesses; sites that gather newspaper articles on remote
topics of science or culture. There is a vast amount of creative work spread
across the Internet. But as the law is currently crafted, this work is
presumptively illegal.
</p><p>
That presumption will increasingly chill creativity, as the examples of
extreme penalties for vague infringements continue to proliferate. It is
impossible to get a clear sense of what's allowed and what's not, and at the
same time, the penalties for crossing the line are astonishingly harsh.  The
four students who were threatened by the RIAA ( Jesse Jordan of chapter 3
was just one) were threatened with a $98 billion lawsuit for building search
engines that permitted songs to be copied. Yet World-Com&#8212;which
defrauded investors of $11 billion, resulting in a loss to investors in
market capitalization of over $200 billion&#8212;received a fine of a mere
$750 million.<sup>[<a name="id2698126" href="#ftn.id2698126" class="footnote">157</a>]</sup> And under legislation
being pushed in Congress right now, a doctor who negligently removes the
wrong leg in an operation would be liable for no more than $250,000 in
damages for pain and suffering.<sup>[<a name="id2698162" href="#ftn.id2698162" class="footnote">158</a>]</sup> Can
common sense recognize the absurdity in a world where the maximum fine for
downloading two songs off the Internet is more than the fine for a doctor's
negligently butchering a patient? <a class="indexterm" name="id2698199"></a>
</p><p>
The consequence of this legal uncertainty, tied to these extremely high
penalties, is that an extraordinary amount of creativity will either never
be exercised, or never be exercised in the open. We drive this creative
process underground by branding the modern-day Walt Disneys "pirates." We
make it impossible for businesses to rely upon a public domain, because the
boundaries of the public domain are designed to be unclear. It never pays to
do anything except pay for the right to create, and hence only those who can
pay are allowed to create. As was the case in the Soviet Union, though for
very different reasons, we will begin to see a world of underground
art&#8212;not because the message is necessarily political, or because the
subject is controversial, but because the very act of creating the art is
legally fraught. Already, exhibits of "illegal art" tour the United
States.<sup>[<a name="id2697755" href="#ftn.id2697755" class="footnote">159</a>]</sup> In what does their "illegality"
consist? In the act of mixing the culture around us with an expression that
is critical or reflective.
</p><p>
Part of the reason for this fear of illegality has to do with the changing
law. I described that change in detail in chapter <a class="xref" href="#property-i" title='Kapittel 11. Kapittel ti: "Eiendom"'>11</a>. But an even bigger part has to do with
the increasing ease with which infractions can be tracked. As users of
file-sharing systems discovered in 2002, it is a trivial matter for
copyright owners to get courts to order Internet service providers to reveal
who has what content. It is as if your cassette tape player transmitted a
list of the songs that you played in the privacy of your own home that
anyone could tune into for whatever reason they chose.
</p><p>
Never in our history has a painter had to worry about whether his painting
infringed on someone else's work; but the modern-day painter, using the
tools of Photoshop, sharing content on the Web, must worry all the
time. Images are all around, but the only safe images to use in the act of
creation are those purchased from Corbis or another image farm. And in
purchasing, censoring happens. There is a free market in pencils; we needn't
worry about its effect on creativity. But there is a highly regulated,
monopolized market in cultural icons; the right to cultivate and transform
them is not similarly free.
</p><p>
Lawyers rarely see this because lawyers are rarely empirical. As I described
in chapter <a class="xref" href="#recorders" title="Kapittel 8. Kapittel sju: Innspillerne">8</a>, in
response to the story about documentary filmmaker Jon Else, I have been
lectured again and again by lawyers who insist Else's use was fair use, and
hence I am wrong to say that the law regulates such a use.
</p><p>



But fair use in America simply means the right to hire a lawyer to defend
your right to create. And as lawyers love to forget, our system for
defending rights such as fair use is astonishingly bad&#8212;in practically
every context, but especially here. It costs too much, it delivers too
slowly, and what it delivers often has little connection to the justice
underlying the claim. The legal system may be tolerable for the very rich.
For everyone else, it is an embarrassment to a tradition that prides itself
on the rule of law.
</p><p>
Judges and lawyers can tell themselves that fair use provides adequate
"breathing room" between regulation by the law and the access the law should
allow. But it is a measure of how out of touch our legal system has become
that anyone actually believes this. The rules that publishers impose upon
writers, the rules that film distributors impose upon filmmakers, the rules
that newspapers impose upon journalists&#8212; these are the real laws
governing creativity. And these rules have little relationship to the "law"
with which judges comfort themselves.
</p><p>
For in a world that threatens $150,000 for a single willful infringement of
a copyright, and which demands tens of thousands of dollars to even defend
against a copyright infringement claim, and which would never return to the
wrongfully accused defendant anything of the costs she suffered to defend
her right to speak&#8212;in that world, the astonishingly broad regulations
that pass under the name "copyright" silence speech and creativity. And in
that world, it takes a studied blindness for people to continue to believe
they live in a culture that is free.
</p><p>
As Jed Horovitz, the businessman behind Video Pipeline, said to me,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

We're losing [creative] opportunities right and left. Creative people are
being forced not to express themselves. Thoughts are not being
expressed. And while a lot of stuff may [still] be created, it still won't
get distributed. Even if the stuff gets made . . . you're not going to get
it distributed in the mainstream media unless you've got a little note from
a lawyer saying, "This has been cleared." You're not even going to get it on
PBS without that kind of permission. That's the point at which they control
it.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="section" title="Constraining Innovators"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="innovators"></a>Constraining Innovators</h2></div></div></div><p>
The story of the last section was a crunchy-lefty story&#8212;creativity
quashed, artists who can't speak, yada yada yada. Maybe that doesn't get you
going. Maybe you think there's enough weird art out there, and enough
expression that is critical of what seems to be just about everything.  And
if you think that, you might think there's little in this story to worry
you.
</p><p>
But there's an aspect of this story that is not lefty in any sense.  Indeed,
it is an aspect that could be written by the most extreme promarket
ideologue. And if you're one of these sorts (and a special one at that, 188
pages into a book like this), then you can see this other aspect by
substituting "free market" every place I've spoken of "free culture." The
point is the same, even if the interests affecting culture are more
fundamental.
</p><p>
The charge I've been making about the regulation of culture is the same
charge free marketers make about regulating markets. Everyone, of course,
concedes that some regulation of markets is necessary&#8212;at a minimum, we
need rules of property and contract, and courts to enforce both. Likewise,
in this culture debate, everyone concedes that at least some framework of
copyright is also required. But both perspectives vehemently insist that
just because some regulation is good, it doesn't follow that more regulation
is better. And both perspectives are constantly attuned to the ways in which
regulation simply enables the powerful industries of today to protect
themselves against the competitors of tomorrow.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2698394"></a><p>

This is the single most dramatic effect of the shift in regulatory strategy
that I described in chapter <a class="xref" href="#property-i" title='Kapittel 11. Kapittel ti: "Eiendom"'>11</a>. The consequence of this massive threat of liability
tied to the murky boundaries of copyright law is that innovators who want to
innovate in this space can safely innovate only if they have the sign-off
from last generation's dominant industries.  That lesson has been taught
through a series of cases that were designed and executed to teach venture
capitalists a lesson. That lesson&#8212;what former Napster CEO Hank Barry
calls a "nuclear pall" that has fallen over the Valley&#8212;has been
learned.
</p><p>
Consider one example to make the point, a story whose beginning I told in
<em class="citetitle">The Future of Ideas</em> and which has progressed in a way
that even I (pessimist extraordinaire) would never have predicted.
</p><p>
In 1997, Michael Roberts launched a company called MP3.com.  MP3.com was
keen to remake the music business. Their goal was not just to facilitate new
ways to get access to content. Their goal was also to facilitate new ways to
create content. Unlike the major labels, MP3.com offered creators a venue to
distribute their creativity, without demanding an exclusive engagement from
the creators.
</p><p>
To make this system work, however, MP3.com needed a reliable way to
recommend music to its users. The idea behind this alternative was to
leverage the revealed preferences of music listeners to recommend new
artists. If you like Lyle Lovett, you're likely to enjoy Bonnie Raitt. And
so on.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2698463"></a>
</p><p>
This idea required a simple way to gather data about user preferences.
MP3.com came up with an extraordinarily clever way to gather this preference
data. In January 2000, the company launched a service called
my.mp3.com. Using software provided by MP3.com, a user would sign into an
account and then insert into her computer a CD. The software would identify
the CD, and then give the user access to that content.  So, for example, if
you inserted a CD by Jill Sobule, then wherever you were&#8212;at work or at
home&#8212;you could get access to that music once you signed into your
account. The system was therefore a kind of music-lockbox.
</p><p>

No doubt some could use this system to illegally copy content. But that
opportunity existed with or without MP3.com. The aim of the my.mp3.com
service was to give users access to their own content, and as a by-product,
by seeing the content they already owned, to discover the kind of content
the users liked.
</p><p>
To make this system function, however, MP3.com needed to copy 50,000 CDs to
a server. (In principle, it could have been the user who uploaded the music,
but that would have taken a great deal of time, and would have produced a
product of questionable quality.) It therefore purchased 50,000 CDs from a
store, and started the process of making copies of those CDs. Again, it
would not serve the content from those copies to anyone except those who
authenticated that they had a copy of the CD they wanted to access. So while
this was 50,000 copies, it was 50,000 copies directed at giving customers
something they had already bought.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxvivendiuniversal"></a><p>
Nine days after MP3.com launched its service, the five major labels, headed
by the RIAA, brought a lawsuit against MP3.com. MP3.com settled with four of
the five. Nine months later, a federal judge found MP3.com to have been
guilty of willful infringement with respect to the fifth. Applying the law
as it is, the judge imposed a fine against MP3.com of $118 million. MP3.com
then settled with the remaining plaintiff, Vivendi Universal, paying over
$54 million. Vivendi purchased MP3.com just about a year later.
</p><p>
Den delen av historien har jeg fortalt før.  Nå kommer konklusjonen.
</p><p>
After Vivendi purchased MP3.com, Vivendi turned around and filed a
malpractice lawsuit against the lawyers who had advised it that they had a
good faith claim that the service they wanted to offer would be considered
legal under copyright law. This lawsuit alleged that it should have been
obvious that the courts would find this behavior illegal; therefore, this
lawsuit sought to punish any lawyer who had dared to suggest that the law
was less restrictive than the labels demanded.
</p><p>

Den åpenbare hensikten med dette søksmålet (som ble avsluttet med et forlik
for et uspesifisert beløp like etter at saken ikke lenger fikk
pressedekning), var å sende en melding som ikke kan misforstås til advokater
som gir råd til klienter på dette området: Det er ikke bare dine klienter
som får lide hvis innholdsindustrien retter sine våpen mot dem.  Det får
også du.  Så de av dere som tror loven burde være mindre restriktiv bør
innse at et slikt syn på loven vil koste deg og ditt firma dyrt.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2698567"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2698575"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2698582"></a><p>
This strategy is not just limited to the lawyers. In April 2003, Universal
and EMI brought a lawsuit against Hummer Winblad, the venture capital firm
(VC) that had funded Napster at a certain stage of its development, its
cofounder ( John Hummer), and general partner (Hank Barry).<sup>[<a name="id2698595" href="#ftn.id2698595" class="footnote">160</a>]</sup> The claim here, as well, was that the VC should
have recognized the right of the content industry to control how the
industry should develop. They should be held personally liable for funding a
company whose business turned out to be beyond the law. Here again, the aim
of the lawsuit is transparent: Any VC now recognizes that if you fund a
company whose business is not approved of by the dinosaurs, you are at risk
not just in the marketplace, but in the courtroom as well.  Your investment
buys you not only a company, it also buys you a lawsuit.  So extreme has the
environment become that even car manufacturers are afraid of technologies
that touch content. In an article in <em class="citetitle">Business 2.0</em>,
Rafe Needleman describes a discussion with BMW:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><a class="indexterm" name="id2698637"></a><p>
I asked why, with all the storage capacity and computer power in the car,
there was no way to play MP3 files. I was told that BMW engineers in Germany
had rigged a new vehicle to play MP3s via the car's built-in sound system,
but that the company's marketing and legal departments weren't comfortable
with pushing this forward for release stateside. Even today, no new cars are
sold in the United States with bona fide MP3 players. . . . <sup>[<a name="id2698653" href="#ftn.id2698653" class="footnote">161</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Dette er verden til mafiaen&#8212;fylt med "penger eller livet"-trusler, som
ikke er regulert av domstolene men av trusler som loven gir
rettighetsinnehaver mulighet til å komme med. Det er et system som åpenbart
og nødvendigvis vil kvele ny innovasjon. Det er vanskelig nok å starte et
selskap. Det blir helt umulig hvis selskapet er stadig truet av søksmål.
</p><p>



The point is not that businesses should have a right to start illegal
enterprises. The point is the definition of "illegal." The law is a mess of
uncertainty. We have no good way to know how it should apply to new
technologies. Yet by reversing our tradition of judicial deference, and by
embracing the astonishingly high penalties that copyright law imposes, that
uncertainty now yields a reality which is far more conservative than is
right. If the law imposed the death penalty for parking tickets, we'd not
only have fewer parking tickets, we'd also have much less driving. The same
principle applies to innovation. If innovation is constantly checked by this
uncertain and unlimited liability, we will have much less vibrant innovation
and much less creativity.
</p><p>
The point is directly parallel to the crunchy-lefty point about fair
use. Whatever the "real" law is, realism about the effect of law in both
contexts is the same. This wildly punitive system of regulation will
systematically stifle creativity and innovation. It will protect some
industries and some creators, but it will harm industry and creativity
generally. Free market and free culture depend upon vibrant competition.
Yet the effect of the law today is to stifle just this kind of competition.
The effect is to produce an overregulated culture, just as the effect of too
much control in the market is to produce an overregulatedregulated market.

The building of a permission culture, rather than a free culture, is the
first important way in which the changes I have described will burden
innovation. A permission culture means a lawyer's culture&#8212;a culture in
which the ability to create requires a call to your lawyer. Again, I am not
antilawyer, at least when they're kept in their proper place. I am certainly
not antilaw. But our profession has lost the sense of its limits. And
leaders in our profession have lost an appreciation of the high costs that
our profession imposes upon others. The inefficiency of the law is an
embarrassment to our tradition. And while I believe our profession should
therefore do everything it can to make the law more efficient, it should at
least do everything it can to limit the reach of the law where the law is
not doing any good. The transaction costs buried within a permission culture
are enough to bury a wide range of creativity.  Someone needs to do a lot of
justifying to justify that result.  The uncertainty of the law is one burden
on innovation. There is a second burden that operates more directly. This is
the effort by many in the content industry to use the law to directly
regulate the technology of the Internet so that it better protects their
content.
</p><p>
The motivation for this response is obvious. The Internet enables the
efficient spread of content. That efficiency is a feature of the Internet's
design. But from the perspective of the content industry, this feature is a
"bug." The efficient spread of content means that content distributors have
a harder time controlling the distribution of content.  One obvious response
to this efficiency is thus to make the Internet less efficient. If the
Internet enables "piracy," then, this response says, we should break the
kneecaps of the Internet.
</p><p>
The examples of this form of legislation are many. At the urging of the
content industry, some in Congress have threatened legislation that would
require computers to determine whether the content they access is protected
or not, and to disable the spread of protected content.<sup>[<a name="id2698787" href="#ftn.id2698787" class="footnote">162</a>]</sup> Congress has already launched proceedings to
explore a mandatory "broadcast flag" that would be required on any device
capable of transmitting digital video (i.e., a computer), and that would
disable the copying of any content that is marked with a broadcast
flag. Other members of Congress have proposed immunizing content providers
from liability for technology they might deploy that would hunt down
copyright violators and disable their machines.<sup>[<a name="id2698810" href="#ftn.id2698810" class="footnote">163</a>]</sup>

</p><p>

In one sense, these solutions seem sensible. If the problem is the code, why
not regulate the code to remove the problem. But any regulation of technical
infrastructure will always be tuned to the particular technology of the
day. It will impose significant burdens and costs on the technology, but
will likely be eclipsed by advances around exactly those requirements.
</p><p>
In March 2002, a broad coalition of technology companies, led by Intel,
tried to get Congress to see the harm that such legislation would
impose.<sup>[<a name="id2698833" href="#ftn.id2698833" class="footnote">164</a>]</sup> Their argument was obviously
not that copyright should not be protected. Instead, they argued, any
protection should not do more harm than good.
</p><p>
There is one more obvious way in which this war has harmed
innovation&#8212;again, a story that will be quite familiar to the free
market crowd.
</p><p>
Copyright may be property, but like all property, it is also a form of
regulation. It is a regulation that benefits some and harms others.  When
done right, it benefits creators and harms leeches. When done wrong, it is
regulation the powerful use to defeat competitors.
</p><p>
As I described in chapter <a class="xref" href="#property-i" title='Kapittel 11. Kapittel ti: "Eiendom"'>11</a>, despite this feature of copyright as regulation, and
subject to important qualifications outlined by Jessica Litman in her book
<em class="citetitle">Digital Copyright</em>,<sup>[<a name="id2698873" href="#ftn.id2698873" class="footnote">165</a>]</sup> overall this history of copyright is not bad. As chapter 10
details, when new technologies have come along, Congress has struck a
balance to assure that the new is protected from the old. Compulsory, or
statutory, licenses have been one part of that strategy. Free use (as in the
case of the VCR) has been another.
</p><p>
But that pattern of deference to new technologies has now changed with the
rise of the Internet. Rather than striking a balance between the claims of a
new technology and the legitimate rights of content creators, both the
courts and Congress have imposed legal restrictions that will have the
effect of smothering the new to benefit the old.
</p><p>
The response by the courts has been fairly universal.<sup>[<a name="id2698908" href="#ftn.id2698908" class="footnote">166</a>]</sup> It has been mirrored in the responses threatened
and actually implemented by Congress. I won't catalog all of those responses
here.<sup>[<a name="id2698943" href="#ftn.id2698943" class="footnote">167</a>]</sup> But there is one example that
captures the flavor of them all. This is the story of the demise of Internet
radio.
</p><p>



As I described in chapter <a class="xref" href="#pirates" title='Kapittel 5. Kapittel fire: "Pirater"'>5</a>, when a radio station plays a song, the recording artist
doesn't get paid for that "radio performance" unless he or she is also the
composer. So, for example if Marilyn Monroe had recorded a version of "Happy
Birthday"&#8212;to memorialize her famous performance before President
Kennedy at Madison Square Garden&#8212; then whenever that recording was
played on the radio, the current copyright owners of "Happy Birthday" would
get some money, whereas Marilyn Monroe would not.
</p><p>
The reasoning behind this balance struck by Congress makes some sense. The
justification was that radio was a kind of advertising. The recording artist
thus benefited because by playing her music, the radio station was making it
more likely that her records would be purchased.  Thus, the recording artist
got something, even if only indirectly.  Probably this reasoning had less to
do with the result than with the power of radio stations: Their lobbyists
were quite good at stopping any efforts to get Congress to require
compensation to the recording artists.
</p><p>
Enter Internet radio. Like regular radio, Internet radio is a technology to
stream content from a broadcaster to a listener. The broadcast travels
across the Internet, not across the ether of radio spectrum.  Thus, I can
"tune in" to an Internet radio station in Berlin while sitting in San
Francisco, even though there's no way for me to tune in to a regular radio
station much beyond the San Francisco metropolitan area.
</p><p>
This feature of the architecture of Internet radio means that there are
potentially an unlimited number of radio stations that a user could tune in
to using her computer, whereas under the existing architecture for broadcast
radio, there is an obvious limit to the number of broadcasters and clear
broadcast frequencies. Internet radio could therefore be more competitive
than regular radio; it could provide a wider range of selections. And
because the potential audience for Internet radio is the whole world, niche
stations could easily develop and market their content to a relatively large
number of users worldwide. According to some estimates, more than eighty
million users worldwide have tuned in to this new form of radio.
</p><p>



Internet radio is thus to radio what FM was to AM. It is an improvement
potentially vastly more significant than the FM improvement over AM, since
not only is the technology better, so, too, is the competition. Indeed,
there is a direct parallel between the fight to establish FM radio and the
fight to protect Internet radio. As one author describes Howard Armstrong's
struggle to enable FM radio,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
An almost unlimited number of FM stations was possible in the shortwaves,
thus ending the unnatural restrictions imposed on radio in the crowded
longwaves. If FM were freely developed, the number of stations would be
limited only by economics and competition rather than by technical
restrictions. . . . Armstrong likened the situation that had grown up in
radio to that following the invention of the printing press, when
governments and ruling interests attempted to control this new instrument of
mass communications by imposing restrictive licenses on it. This tyranny was
broken only when it became possible for men freely to acquire printing
presses and freely to run them. FM in this sense was as great an invention
as the printing presses, for it gave radio the opportunity to strike off its
shackles.<sup>[<a name="id2699069" href="#ftn.id2699069" class="footnote">168</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This potential for FM radio was never realized&#8212;not because Armstrong
was wrong about the technology, but because he underestimated the power of
"vested interests, habits, customs and legislation"<sup>[<a name="id2698849" href="#ftn.id2698849" class="footnote">169</a>]</sup> to retard the growth of this competing technology.
</p><p>
Now the very same claim could be made about Internet radio. For again, there
is no technical limitation that could restrict the number of Internet radio
stations. The only restrictions on Internet radio are those imposed by the
law. Copyright law is one such law. So the first question we should ask is,
what copyright rules would govern Internet radio?
</p><p>

But here the power of the lobbyists is reversed. Internet radio is a new
industry. The recording artists, on the other hand, have a very powerful
lobby, the RIAA. Thus when Congress considered the phenomenon of Internet
radio in 1995, the lobbyists had primed Congress to adopt a different rule
for Internet radio than the rule that applies to terrestrial radio. While
terrestrial radio does not have to pay our hypothetical Marilyn Monroe when
it plays her hypothetical recording of "Happy Birthday" on the air,
<span class="emphasis"><em>Internet radio does</em></span>. Not only is the law not neutral
toward Internet radio&#8212;the law actually burdens Internet radio more
than it burdens terrestrial radio.
</p><p>
This financial burden is not slight. As Harvard law professor William Fisher
estimates, if an Internet radio station distributed adfree popular music to
(on average) ten thousand listeners, twenty-four hours a day, the total
artist fees that radio station would owe would be over $1 million a
year.<sup>[<a name="id2699129" href="#ftn.id2699129" class="footnote">170</a>]</sup> A regular radio station
broadcasting the same content would pay no equivalent fee.
</p><p>
The burden is not financial only. Under the original rules that were
proposed, an Internet radio station (but not a terrestrial radio station)
would have to collect the following data from <span class="emphasis"><em>every listening
transaction</em></span>:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>

The Librarian of Congress eventually suspended these reporting requirements,
pending further study. And he also changed the original rates set by the
arbitration panel charged with setting rates. But the basic difference
between Internet radio and terrestrial radio remains: Internet radio has to
pay a <span class="emphasis"><em>type of copyright fee</em></span> that terrestrial radio does
not.
</p><p>
Why? What justifies this difference? Was there any study of the economic
consequences from Internet radio that would justify these differences? Was
the motive to protect artists against piracy?
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2699340"></a><p>
In a rare bit of candor, one RIAA expert admitted what seemed obvious to
everyone at the time. As Alex Alben, vice president for Public Policy at
Real Networks, told me,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

The RIAA, which was representing the record labels, presented some testimony
about what they thought a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller, and
it was much higher. It was ten times higher than what radio stations pay to
perform the same songs for the same period of time. And so the attorneys
representing the webcasters asked the RIAA, . . . "How do you come up with a
rate that's so much higher? Why is it worth more than radio? Because here we
have hundreds of thousands of webcasters who want to pay, and that should
establish the market rate, and if you set the rate so high, you're going to
drive the small webcasters out of business. . . ."
</p><p>
And the RIAA experts said, "Well, we don't really model this as an industry
with thousands of webcasters, <span class="emphasis"><em>we think it should be an industry
with, you know, five or seven big players who can pay a high rate and it's a
stable, predictable market</em></span>." (Emphasis added.)
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Translation: The aim is to use the law to eliminate competition, so that
this platform of potentially immense competition, which would cause the
diversity and range of content available to explode, would not cause pain to
the dinosaurs of old. There is no one, on either the right or the left, who
should endorse this use of the law. And yet there is practically no one, on
either the right or the left, who is doing anything effective to prevent it.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Corrupting Citizens"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="corruptingcitizens"></a>Corrupting Citizens</h2></div></div></div><p>
Overregulation stifles creativity. It smothers innovation. It gives
dinosaurs a veto over the future. It wastes the extraordinary opportunity
for a democratic creativity that digital technology enables.
</p><p>
In addition to these important harms, there is one more that was important
to our forebears, but seems forgotten today. Overregulation corrupts
citizens and weakens the rule of law.
</p><p>

The war that is being waged today is a war of prohibition. As with every war
of prohibition, it is targeted against the behavior of a very large number
of citizens. According to <em class="citetitle">The New York Times</em>, 43
million Americans downloaded music in May 2002.<sup>[<a name="id2699427" href="#ftn.id2699427" class="footnote">171</a>]</sup> According to the RIAA, the behavior of those 43 million Americans
is a felony. We thus have a set of rules that transform 20 percent of
America into criminals. As the RIAA launches lawsuits against not only the
Napsters and Kazaas of the world, but against students building search
engines, and increasingly against ordinary users downloading content, the
technologies for sharing will advance to further protect and hide illegal
use. It is an arms race or a civil war, with the extremes of one side
inviting a more extreme response by the other.
</p><p>
The content industry's tactics exploit the failings of the American legal
system. When the RIAA brought suit against Jesse Jordan, it knew that in
Jordan it had found a scapegoat, not a defendant. The threat of having to
pay either all the money in the world in damages ($15,000,000) or almost all
the money in the world to defend against paying all the money in the world
in damages ($250,000 in legal fees)  led Jordan to choose to pay all the
money he had in the world ($12,000) to make the suit go away. The same
strategy animates the RIAA's suits against individual users. In September
2003, the RIAA sued 261 individuals&#8212;including a twelve-year-old girl
living in public housing and a seventy-year-old man who had no idea what
file sharing was.<sup>[<a name="id2699119" href="#ftn.id2699119" class="footnote">172</a>]</sup> As these scapegoats
discovered, it will always cost more to defend against these suits than it
would cost to simply settle. (The twelve year old, for example, like Jesse
Jordan, paid her life savings of $2,000 to settle the case.) Our law is an
awful system for defending rights. It is an embarrassment to our
tradition. And the consequence of our law as it is, is that those with the
power can use the law to quash any rights they oppose.
</p><p>
Wars of prohibition are nothing new in America. This one is just something
more extreme than anything we've seen before. We experimented with alcohol
prohibition, at a time when the per capita consumption of alcohol was 1.5
gallons per capita per year. The war against drinking initially reduced that
consumption to just 30 percent of its preprohibition levels, but by the end
of prohibition, consumption was up to 70 percent of the preprohibition
level. Americans were drinking just about as much, but now, a vast number
were criminals.<sup>[<a name="id2699502" href="#ftn.id2699502" class="footnote">173</a>]</sup> We have launched a war
on drugs aimed at reducing the consumption of regulated narcotics that 7
percent (or 16 million) Americans now use.<sup>[<a name="id2699515" href="#ftn.id2699515" class="footnote">174</a>]</sup> That is a drop from the high (so to speak) in 1979 of 14 percent of
the population. We regulate automobiles to the point where the vast majority
of Americans violate the law every day. We run such a complex tax system
that a majority of cash businesses regularly cheat.<sup>[<a name="id2699532" href="#ftn.id2699532" class="footnote">175</a>]</sup> We pride ourselves on our "free society," but an
endless array of ordinary behavior is regulated within our society. And as a
result, a huge proportion of Americans regularly violate at least some law.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2699548"></a>
</p><p>
This state of affairs is not without consequence. It is a particularly
salient issue for teachers like me, whose job it is to teach law students
about the importance of "ethics." As my colleague Charlie Nesson told a
class at Stanford, each year law schools admit thousands of students who
have illegally downloaded music, illegally consumed alcohol and sometimes
drugs, illegally worked without paying taxes, illegally driven cars. These
are kids for whom behaving illegally is increasingly the norm. And then we,
as law professors, are supposed to teach them how to behave
ethically&#8212;how to say no to bribes, or keep client funds separate, or
honor a demand to disclose a document that will mean that your case is
over. Generations of Americans&#8212;more significantly in some parts of
America than in others, but still, everywhere in America today&#8212;can't
live their lives both normally and legally, since "normally" entails a
certain degree of illegality.
</p><p>
The response to this general illegality is either to enforce the law more
severely or to change the law. We, as a society, have to learn how to make
that choice more rationally. Whether a law makes sense depends, in part, at
least, upon whether the costs of the law, both intended and collateral,
outweigh the benefits. If the costs, intended and collateral, do outweigh
the benefits, then the law ought to be changed.  Alternatively, if the costs
of the existing system are much greater than the costs of an alternative,
then we have a good reason to consider the alternative.
</p><p>



My point is not the idiotic one: Just because people violate a law, we
should therefore repeal it. Obviously, we could reduce murder statistics
dramatically by legalizing murder on Wednesdays and Fridays. But that
wouldn't make any sense, since murder is wrong every day of the week. A
society is right to ban murder always and everywhere.
</p><p>
My point is instead one that democracies understood for generations, but
that we recently have learned to forget. The rule of law depends upon people
obeying the law. The more often, and more repeatedly, we as citizens
experience violating the law, the less we respect the law. Obviously, in
most cases, the important issue is the law, not respect for the law. I don't
care whether the rapist respects the law or not; I want to catch and
incarcerate the rapist. But I do care whether my students respect the
law. And I do care if the rules of law sow increasing disrespect because of
the extreme of regulation they impose.  Twenty million Americans have come
of age since the Internet introduced this different idea of "sharing." We
need to be able to call these twenty million Americans "citizens," not
"felons."
</p><p>
When at least forty-three million citizens download content from the
Internet, and when they use tools to combine that content in ways
unauthorized by copyright holders, the first question we should be asking is
not how best to involve the FBI. The first question should be whether this
particular prohibition is really necessary in order to achieve the proper
ends that copyright law serves. Is there another way to assure that artists
get paid without transforming forty-three million Americans into felons?
Does it make sense if there are other ways to assure that artists get paid
without transforming America into a nation of felons?
</p><p>
This abstract point can be made more clear with a particular example.
</p><p>

We all own CDs. Many of us still own phonograph records. These pieces of
plastic encode music that in a certain sense we have bought.  The law
protects our right to buy and sell that plastic: It is not a copyright
infringement for me to sell all my classical records at a used record store
and buy jazz records to replace them. That "use" of the recordings is free.
</p><p>
But as the MP3 craze has demonstrated, there is another use of phonograph
records that is effectively free. Because these recordings were made without
copy-protection technologies, I am "free" to copy, or "rip," music from my
records onto a computer hard disk. Indeed, Apple Corporation went so far as
to suggest that "freedom" was a right: In a series of commercials, Apple
endorsed the "Rip, Mix, Burn" capacities of digital technologies.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2699658"></a><p>
This "use" of my records is certainly valuable. I have begun a large process
at home of ripping all of my and my wife's CDs, and storing them in one
archive. Then, using Apple's iTunes, or a wonderful program called
Andromeda, we can build different play lists of our music: Bach, Baroque,
Love Songs, Love Songs of Significant Others&#8212;the potential is
endless. And by reducing the costs of mixing play lists, these technologies
help build a creativity with play lists that is itself independently
valuable. Compilations of songs are creative and meaningful in their own
right.
</p><p>
This use is enabled by unprotected media&#8212;either CDs or records.  But
unprotected media also enable file sharing. File sharing threatens (or so
the content industry believes) the ability of creators to earn a fair return
from their creativity. And thus, many are beginning to experiment with
technologies to eliminate unprotected media. These technologies, for
example, would enable CDs that could not be ripped. Or they might enable spy
programs to identify ripped content on people's machines.
</p><p>

If these technologies took off, then the building of large archives of your
own music would become quite difficult. You might hang in hacker circles,
and get technology to disable the technologies that protect the
content. Trading in those technologies is illegal, but maybe that doesn't
bother you much. In any case, for the vast majority of people, these
protection technologies would effectively destroy the archiving use of
CDs. The technology, in other words, would force us all back to the world
where we either listened to music by manipulating pieces of plastic or were
part of a massively complex "digital rights management" system.
</p><p>
If the only way to assure that artists get paid were the elimination of the
ability to freely move content, then these technologies to interfere with
the freedom to move content would be justifiable. But what if there were
another way to assure that artists are paid, without locking down any
content? What if, in other words, a different system could assure
compensation to artists while also preserving the freedom to move content
easily?
</p><p>
My point just now is not to prove that there is such a system. I offer a
version of such a system in the last chapter of this book. For now, the only
point is the relatively uncontroversial one: If a different system achieved
the same legitimate objectives that the existing copyright system achieved,
but left consumers and creators much more free, then we'd have a very good
reason to pursue this alternative&#8212;namely, freedom.  The choice, in
other words, would not be between property and piracy; the choice would be
between different property systems and the freedoms each allowed.
</p><p>
I believe there is a way to assure that artists are paid without turning
forty-three million Americans into felons. But the salient feature of this
alternative is that it would lead to a very different market for producing
and distributing creativity. The dominant few, who today control the vast
majority of the distribution of content in the world, would no longer
exercise this extreme of control. Rather, they would go the way of the
horse-drawn buggy.
</p><p>
Except that this generation's buggy manufacturers have already saddled
Congress, and are riding the law to protect themselves against this new form
of competition. For them the choice is between fortythree million Americans
as criminals and their own survival.
</p><p>
It is understandable why they choose as they do. It is not understandable
why we as a democracy continue to choose as we do. Jack Valenti is charming;
but not so charming as to justify giving up a tradition as deep and
important as our tradition of free culture.  There's one more aspect to this
corruption that is particularly important to civil liberties, and follows
directly from any war of prohibition.  As Electronic Frontier Foundation
attorney Fred von Lohmann describes, this is the "collateral damage" that
"arises whenever you turn a very large percentage of the population into
criminals." This is the collateral damage to civil liberties generally.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2699770"></a>
</p><p>
"Hvis du kan behandle noen som en antatt lovbryter," forklarer von Lohmann,
<a class="indexterm" name="id2699784"></a>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
then all of a sudden a lot of basic civil liberty protections evaporate to
one degree or another. . . . If you're a copyright infringer, how can you
hope to have any privacy rights? If you're a copyright infringer, how can
you hope to be secure against seizures of your computer? How can you hope to
continue to receive Internet access? . . . Our sensibilities change as soon
as we think, "Oh, well, but that person's a criminal, a lawbreaker." Well,
what this campaign against file sharing has done is turn a remarkable
percentage of the American Internet-using population into "lawbreakers."
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And the consequence of this transformation of the American public into
criminals is that it becomes trivial, as a matter of due process, to
effectively erase much of the privacy most would presume.
</p><p>
Users of the Internet began to see this generally in 2003 as the RIAA
launched its campaign to force Internet service providers to turn over the
names of customers who the RIAA believed were violating copyright
law. Verizon fought that demand and lost. With a simple request to a judge,
and without any notice to the customer at all, the identity of an Internet
user is revealed.
</p><p>

The RIAA then expanded this campaign, by announcing a general strategy to
sue individual users of the Internet who are alleged to have downloaded
copyrighted music from file-sharing systems. But as we've seen, the
potential damages from these suits are astronomical: If a family's computer
is used to download a single CD's worth of music, the family could be liable
for $2 million in damages. That didn't stop the RIAA from suing a number of
these families, just as they had sued Jesse Jordan.<sup>[<a name="id2699834" href="#ftn.id2699834" class="footnote">176</a>]</sup>

</p><p>
Even this understates the espionage that is being waged by the RIAA. A
report from CNN late last summer described a strategy the RIAA had adopted
to track Napster users.<sup>[<a name="id2699875" href="#ftn.id2699875" class="footnote">177</a>]</sup> Using a
sophisticated hashing algorithm, the RIAA took what is in effect a
fingerprint of every song in the Napster catalog. Any copy of one of those
MP3s will have the same "fingerprint."
</p><p>
So imagine the following not-implausible scenario: Imagine a friend gives a
CD to your daughter&#8212;a collection of songs just like the cassettes you
used to make as a kid. You don't know, and neither does your daughter, where
these songs came from. But she copies these songs onto her computer. She
then takes her computer to college and connects it to a college network, and
if the college network is "cooperating" with the RIAA's espionage, and she
hasn't properly protected her content from the network (do you know how to
do that yourself ?), then the RIAA will be able to identify your daughter as
a "criminal." And under the rules that universities are beginning to
deploy,<sup>[<a name="id2699726" href="#ftn.id2699726" class="footnote">178</a>]</sup> your daughter can lose the
right to use the university's computer network.  She can, in some cases, be
expelled.
</p><p>
Now, of course, she'll have the right to defend herself. You can hire a
lawyer for her (at $300 per hour, if you're lucky), and she can plead that
she didn't know anything about the source of the songs or that they came
from Napster. And it may well be that the university believes her. But the
university might not believe her. It might treat this "contraband" as
presumptive of guilt. And as any number of college students have already
learned, our presumptions about innocence disappear in the middle of wars of
prohibition. This war is no different.  Says von Lohmann, <a class="indexterm" name="id2699970"></a>
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So when we're talking about numbers like forty to sixty million Americans
that are essentially copyright infringers, you create a situation where the
civil liberties of those people are very much in peril in a general
matter. [I don't] think [there is any] analog where you could randomly
choose any person off the street and be confident that they were committing
an unlawful act that could put them on the hook for potential felony
liability or hundreds of millions of dollars of civil liability. Certainly
we all speed, but speeding isn't the kind of an act for which we routinely
forfeit civil liberties. Some people use drugs, and I think that's the
closest analog, [but] many have noted that the war against drugs has eroded
all of our civil liberties because it's treated so many Americans as
criminals. Well, I think it's fair to say that file sharing is an order of
magnitude larger number of Americans than drug use. . . . If forty to sixty
million Americans have become lawbreakers, then we're really on a slippery
slope to lose a lot of civil liberties for all forty to sixty million of
them.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
When forty to sixty million Americans are considered "criminals" under the
law, and when the law could achieve the same objective&#8212; securing
rights to authors&#8212;without these millions being considered "criminals,"
who is the villain? Americans or the law? Which is American, a constant war
on our own people or a concerted effort through our democracy to change our
law?

Association of America (RIAA)</em> v. <em class="citetitle">Diamond Multimedia
Systems</em>, 180 F. 3d 1072 (9th Cir. 1999). There the court of

unable to record or redistribute music (a device whose only copying function
is to render portable a music file already stored on a user's hard drive).

For example, in July 2002, Representative Howard Berman introduced the
Peer-to-Peer Piracy Prevention Act (H.R. 5211), which would immunize
copyright holders from liability for damage done to computers when the
copyright holders use technology to stop copyright infringement. In August
2002, Representative Billy Tauzin introduced a bill to mandate that
technologies capable of rebroadcasting digital copies of films broadcast on
TV (i.e., computers) respect a "broadcast flag" that would disable copying
of that content. And in March of the same year, Senator Fritz Hollings
introduced the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act,
which mandated copyright protection technology in all digital media
devices. See GartnerG2, "Copyright and Digital Media in a Post-Napster

Så her er bildet: Du står på siden av veien. Bilen din er på brann. Du er
sint og opprørt fordi du delvis bidro til å starte brannen. Nå vet du ikke
hvordan du slokker den.  Ved siden av deg er en bøtte, fylt med
bensin. Bensin vil åpenbart ikke slukke brannen.
</p><p>
Mens du tenker over situasjonen, kommer noen andre forbi.  I panikk griper
hun bøtta, og før du har hatt sjansen til å be henne stoppe&#8212;eller før
hun forstår hvorfor hun bør stoppe&#8212;er bøtten i svevet.  Bensinen er på
tur mot den brennende bilen.  Og brannen som bensinen kommer til å fyre opp
vil straks sette fyr på alt i omgivelsene.
</p><p>
En krig om opphavsrett pågår over alt&#8212; og vi fokuserer alle på feil
ting.  Det er ingen tvil om at dagens teknologier truer eksisterende
virksomheter.  Uten tvil kan de true artister.  Men teknologier endrer seg.
Industrien og teknologer har en rekke måter å bruke teknologi til å beskytte
dem selv mot dagens trusler på Internet.  Dette er en brann som overlatt til
seg selv vil brenne ut.
</p><p>


Likevel er ikke besluttningstagere villig til å la denne brannen i fred.
Ladet med masse penger fra lobbyister er de lystne på å gå i mellom for å
fjerne problemet slik de oppfatter det.  Men problemet slik de oppfatter det
er ikke den reelle trusselen som denne kulturen står med ansiktet mot.  For
mens vi ser på denne lille brannen i hjørnet er det en massiv endring i
hvordan kultur blir skapt som pågår over alt. 
</p><p>
På en eller annen måte må vi klare å snu oppmerksomheten mot dette mer
viktige og fundametale problemet.  Vi må finne en måte å unngå å helle
bensin på denne brannen.
</p><p>
Vi har ikke funne denne måten ennå.  Istedet synes vi å være fanget i en
enklere og sort-hvit tenkning.  Uansett hvor mange folk som presser på for å
gjøre rammen for debatten litt bredere, er det dette enkle sort-hvit-synet
som består.  Vi kjører sakte forbi og stirrer på brannen når vi i stedet
burde holde øynene på veien.
</p><p>
Denne utfordringen har vært livet mitt de siste årene.  Det har også vært
min falitt.  I de to neste kapittlene, beskriver jeg en liten innsats, så
langt uten suksess, på å finne en måte å endre fokus på denne debatten.  Vi
må forstå disse mislyktede forsøkene hvis vi skal forstå hva som kreves for
å lykkes.

In 1995, a father was frustrated that his daughters didn't seem to like
Hawthorne. No doubt there was more than one such father, but at least one
did something about it. Eric Eldred, a retired computer programmer living in
New Hampshire, decided to put Hawthorne on the Web. An electronic version,
Eldred thought, with links to pictures and explanatory text, would make this
nineteenth-century author's work come alive.
</p><p>
It didn't work&#8212;at least for his daughters. They didn't find Hawthorne
any more interesting than before. But Eldred's experiment gave birth to a
hobby, and his hobby begat a cause: Eldred would build a library of public
domain works by scanning these works and making them available for free.
</p><p>

Eldred's library was not simply a copy of certain public domain works,
though even a copy would have been of great value to people across the world
who can't get access to printed versions of these works. Instead, Eldred was
producing derivative works from these public domain works. Just as Disney
turned Grimm into stories more accessible to the twentieth century, Eldred
transformed Hawthorne, and many others, into a form more
accessible&#8212;technically accessible&#8212;today.
</p><p>
Eldred's freedom to do this with Hawthorne's work grew from the same source
as Disney's. Hawthorne's <em class="citetitle">Scarlet Letter</em> had passed
into the public domain in 1907. It was free for anyone to take without the
permission of the Hawthorne estate or anyone else. Some, such as Dover Press
and Penguin Classics, take works from the public domain and produce printed
editions, which they sell in bookstores across the country. Others, such as
Disney, take these stories and turn them into animated cartoons, sometimes
successfully (<em class="citetitle">Cinderella</em>), sometimes not
(<em class="citetitle">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, <em class="citetitle">Treasure
Planet</em>). These are all commercial publications of public domain
works.
</p><p>
The Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications of public
domain works. Eldred's is just one example. There are literally thousands of
others. Hundreds of thousands from across the world have discovered this
platform of expression and now use it to share works that are, by law, free
for the taking. This has produced what we might call the "noncommercial
publishing industry," which before the Internet was limited to people with
large egos or with political or social causes. But with the Internet, it
includes a wide range of individuals and groups dedicated to spreading
culture generally.<sup>[<a name="id2700231" href="#ftn.id2700231" class="footnote">179</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
As I said, Eldred lives in New Hampshire. In 1998, Robert Frost's collection
of poems <em class="citetitle">New Hampshire</em> was slated to pass into the
public domain. Eldred wanted to post that collection in his free public
library.  But Congress got in the way. As I described in chapter <a class="xref" href="#property-i" title='Kapittel 11. Kapittel ti: "Eiendom"'>11</a>, in 1998, for the
eleventh time in forty years, Congress extended the terms of existing
copyrights&#8212;this time by twenty years. Eldred would not be free to add
any works more recent than 1923 to his collection until 2019.  Indeed, no
copyrighted work would pass into the public domain until that year (and not
even then, if Congress extends the term again). By contrast, in the same
period, more than 1 million patents will pass into the public domain.
</p><p>


This was the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), enacted in
memory of the congressman and former musician Sonny Bono, who, his widow,
Mary Bono, says, believed that "copyrights should be forever."<sup>[<a name="id2700285" href="#ftn.id2700285" class="footnote">180</a>]</sup>

</p><p>
Eldred decided to fight this law. He first resolved to fight it through
civil disobedience. In a series of interviews, Eldred announced that he
would publish as planned, CTEA notwithstanding. But because of a second law
passed in 1998, the NET (No Electronic Theft) Act, his act of publishing
would make Eldred a felon&#8212;whether or not anyone complained. This was a
dangerous strategy for a disabled programmer to undertake.
</p><p>
It was here that I became involved in Eldred's battle. I was a
constitutional scholar whose first passion was constitutional
interpretation.  And though constitutional law courses never focus upon the
Progress Clause of the Constitution, it had always struck me as importantly
different. As you know, the Constitution says,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science . . .  by securing
for limited Times to Authors . . . exclusive Right to their
. . . Writings. . . .
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As I've described, this clause is unique within the power-granting clause of
Article I, section 8 of our Constitution. Every other clause granting power
to Congress simply says Congress has the power to do something&#8212;for
example, to regulate "commerce among the several states" or "declare War."
But here, the "something" is something quite specific&#8212;to "promote
. . . Progress"&#8212;through means that are also specific&#8212; by
"securing" "exclusive Rights" (i.e., copyrights) "for limited Times."
</p><p>
In the past forty years, Congress has gotten into the practice of extending
existing terms of copyright protection. What puzzled me about this was, if
Congress has the power to extend existing terms, then the Constitution's
requirement that terms be "limited" will have no practical effect. If every
time a copyright is about to expire, Congress has the power to extend its
term, then Congress can achieve what the Constitution plainly
forbids&#8212;perpetual terms "on the installment plan," as Professor Peter
Jaszi so nicely put it.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2700310"></a>
</p><p>
As an academic, my first response was to hit the books. I remember sitting
late at the office, scouring on-line databases for any serious consideration
of the question. No one had ever challenged Congress's practice of extending
existing terms. That failure may in part be why Congress seemed so
untroubled in its habit. That, and the fact that the practice had become so
lucrative for Congress. Congress knows that copyright owners will be willing
to pay a great deal of money to see their copyright terms extended. And so
Congress is quite happy to keep this gravy train going.
</p><p>
For this is the core of the corruption in our present system of
government. "Corruption" not in the sense that representatives are bribed.
Rather, "corruption" in the sense that the system induces the beneficiaries
of Congress's acts to raise and give money to Congress to induce it to
act. There's only so much time; there's only so much Congress can do. Why
not limit its actions to those things it must do&#8212;and those things that
pay? Extending copyright terms pays.
</p><p>
If that's not obvious to you, consider the following: Say you're one of the
very few lucky copyright owners whose copyright continues to make money one
hundred years after it was created. The Estate of Robert Frost is a good
example. Frost died in 1963. His poetry continues to be extraordinarily
valuable. Thus the Robert Frost estate benefits greatly from any extension
of copyright, since no publisher would pay the estate any money if the poems
Frost wrote could be published by anyone for free.
</p><p>
So imagine the Robert Frost estate is earning $100,000 a year from three of
Frost's poems. And imagine the copyright for those poems is about to
expire. You sit on the board of the Robert Frost estate.  Your financial
adviser comes to your board meeting with a very grim report:
</p><p>

"Next year," the adviser announces, "our copyrights in works A, B, and C
will expire. That means that after next year, we will no longer be receiving
the annual royalty check of $100,000 from the publishers of those works.
</p><p>
"There's a proposal in Congress, however," she continues, "that could change
this. A few congressmen are floating a bill to extend the terms of copyright
by twenty years. That bill would be extraordinarily valuable to us. So we
should hope this bill passes."
</p><p>
"Hope?" a fellow board member says. "Can't we be doing something about it?"
</p><p>
"Well, obviously, yes," the adviser responds. "We could contribute to the
campaigns of a number of representatives to try to assure that they support
the bill."
</p><p>
You hate politics. You hate contributing to campaigns. So you want to know
whether this disgusting practice is worth it. "How much would we get if this
extension were passed?" you ask the adviser. "How much is it worth?"
</p><p>
"Well," the adviser says, "if you're confident that you will continue to get
at least $100,000 a year from these copyrights, and you use the `discount
rate' that we use to evaluate estate investments (6 percent), then this law
would be worth $1,146,000 to the estate."
</p><p>
You're a bit shocked by the number, but you quickly come to the correct
conclusion:
</p><p>
"So you're saying it would be worth it for us to pay more than $1,000,000 in
campaign contributions if we were confident those contributions would assure
that the bill was passed?"
</p><p>
"Absolutely," the adviser responds. "It is worth it to you to contribute up
to the `present value' of the income you expect from these copyrights. Which
for us means over $1,000,000."
</p><p>

You quickly get the point&#8212;you as the member of the board and, I trust,
you the reader. Each time copyrights are about to expire, every beneficiary
in the position of the Robert Frost estate faces the same choice: If they
can contribute to get a law passed to extend copyrights, they will benefit
greatly from that extension. And so each time copyrights are about to
expire, there is a massive amount of lobbying to get the copyright term
extended.
</p><p>
Thus a congressional perpetual motion machine: So long as legislation can be
bought (albeit indirectly), there will be all the incentive in the world to
buy further extensions of copyright.
</p><p>
In the lobbying that led to the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term
Extension Act, this "theory" about incentives was proved real. Ten of the
thirteen original sponsors of the act in the House received the maximum
contribution from Disney's political action committee; in the Senate, eight
of the twelve sponsors received contributions.<sup>[<a name="id2700496" href="#ftn.id2700496" class="footnote">181</a>]</sup> The RIAA and the MPAA are estimated to have spent over $1.5 million
lobbying in the 1998 election cycle. They paid out more than $200,000 in
campaign contributions.<sup>[<a name="id2700511" href="#ftn.id2700511" class="footnote">182</a>]</sup> Disney is
estimated to have contributed more than $800,000 to reelection campaigns in
the cycle.<sup>[<a name="id2700526" href="#ftn.id2700526" class="footnote">183</a>]</sup>

</p><p>
Constitutional law is not oblivious to the obvious. Or at least, it need not
be. So when I was considering Eldred's complaint, this reality about the
never-ending incentives to increase the copyright term was central to my
thinking. In my view, a pragmatic court committed to interpreting and
applying the Constitution of our framers would see that if Congress has the
power to extend existing terms, then there would be no effective
constitutional requirement that terms be "limited." If they could extend it
once, they would extend it again and again and again.
</p><p>

It was also my judgment that <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> Supreme Court would
not allow Congress to extend existing terms. As anyone close to the Supreme
Court's work knows, this Court has increasingly restricted the power of
Congress when it has viewed Congress's actions as exceeding the power
granted to it by the Constitution. Among constitutional scholars, the most
famous example of this trend was the Supreme Court's decision in 1995 to
strike down a law that banned the possession of guns near schools.
</p><p>
Since 1937, the Supreme Court had interpreted Congress's granted powers very
broadly; so, while the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate
only "commerce among the several states" (aka "interstate commerce"), the
Supreme Court had interpreted that power to include the power to regulate
any activity that merely affected interstate commerce.
</p><p>
As the economy grew, this standard increasingly meant that there was no
limit to Congress's power to regulate, since just about every activity, when
considered on a national scale, affects interstate commerce.  A Constitution
designed to limit Congress's power was instead interpreted to impose no
limit.
</p><p>
The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Rehnquist's command, changed that in
<em class="citetitle">United States</em> v. <em class="citetitle">Lopez</em>. The
government had argued that possessing guns near schools affected interstate
commerce. Guns near schools increase crime, crime lowers property values,
and so on. In the oral argument, the Chief Justice asked the government
whether there was any activity that would not affect interstate commerce
under the reasoning the government advanced. The government said there was
not; if Congress says an activity affects interstate commerce, then that
activity affects interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, the government
said, was not in the position to second-guess Congress.
</p><p>
"We pause to consider the implications of the government's arguments," the
Chief Justice wrote.<sup>[<a name="id2700616" href="#ftn.id2700616" class="footnote">184</a>]</sup> If anything
Congress says is interstate commerce must therefore be considered interstate
commerce, then there would be no limit to Congress's power. The decision in
<em class="citetitle">Lopez</em> was reaffirmed five years later in
<em class="citetitle">United States</em>
v. <em class="citetitle">Morrison</em>.<sup>[<a name="id2700643" href="#ftn.id2700643" class="footnote">185</a>]</sup>
</p><p>

If a principle were at work here, then it should apply to the Progress
Clause as much as the Commerce Clause.<sup>[<a name="id2700663" href="#ftn.id2700663" class="footnote">186</a>]</sup>
And if it is applied to the Progress Clause, the principle should yield the
conclusion that Congress can't extend an existing term. If Congress could
extend an existing term, then there would be no "stopping point" to
Congress's power over terms, though the Constitution expressly states that
there is such a limit. Thus, the same principle applied to the power to
grant copyrights should entail that Congress is not allowed to extend the
term of existing copyrights.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>If</em></span>, that is, the principle announced in
<em class="citetitle">Lopez</em> stood for a principle.  Many believed the
decision in <em class="citetitle">Lopez</em> stood for politics&#8212;a
conservative Supreme Court, which believed in states' rights, using its
power over Congress to advance its own personal political preferences. But I
rejected that view of the Supreme Court's decision. Indeed, shortly after
the decision, I wrote an article demonstrating the "fidelity" in such an
interpretation of the Constitution. The idea that the Supreme Court decides
cases based upon its politics struck me as extraordinarily boring.  I was
not going to devote my life to teaching constitutional law if these nine
Justices were going to be petty politicians.
</p><p>
Now let's pause for a moment to make sure we understand what the argument in
<em class="citetitle">Eldred</em> was not about. By insisting on the
Constitution's limits to copyright, obviously Eldred was not endorsing
piracy.  Indeed, in an obvious sense, he was fighting a kind of
piracy&#8212;piracy of the public domain. When Robert Frost wrote his work
and when Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, the maximum copyright term was
just fifty-six years. Because of interim changes, Frost and Disney had
already enjoyed a seventy-five-year monopoly for their work. They had gotten
the benefit of the bargain that the Constitution envisions: In exchange for
a monopoly protected for fifty-six years, they created new work. But now
these entities were using their power&#8212;expressed through the power of
lobbyists' money&#8212;to get another twenty-year dollop of monopoly. That
twenty-year dollop would be taken from the public domain. Eric Eldred was
fighting a piracy that affects us all.
</p><p>
Some people view the public domain with contempt. In their brief before the
Supreme Court, the Nashville Songwriters Association wrote that the public
domain is nothing more than "legal piracy."<sup>[<a name="id2700743" href="#ftn.id2700743" class="footnote">187</a>]</sup> But it is not piracy when the law allows it; and in our
constitutional system, our law requires it. Some may not like the
Constitution's requirements, but that doesn't make the Constitution a
pirate's charter.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2700768"></a>
</p><p>
As we've seen, our constitutional system requires limits on copyright as a
way to assure that copyright holders do not too heavily influence the
development and distribution of our culture. Yet, as Eric Eldred discovered,
we have set up a system that assures that copyright terms will be repeatedly
extended, and extended, and extended. We have created the perfect storm for
the public domain. Copyrights have not expired, and will not expire, so long
as Congress is free to be bought to extend them again.
</p><p>
It is valuable copyrights that are responsible for terms being extended.
Mickey Mouse and "Rhapsody in Blue." These works are too valuable for
copyright owners to ignore. But the real harm to our society from copyright
extensions is not that Mickey Mouse remains Disney's.  Forget Mickey
Mouse. Forget Robert Frost. Forget all the works from the 1920s and 1930s
that have continuing commercial value. The real harm of term extension comes
not from these famous works. The real harm is to the works that are not
famous, not commercially exploited, and no longer available as a result.
</p><p>
If you look at the work created in the first twenty years (1923 to 1942)
affected by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 2 percent of that
work has any continuing commercial value. It was the copyright holders for
that 2 percent who pushed the CTEA through.  But the law and its effect were
not limited to that 2 percent. The law extended the terms of copyright
generally.<sup>[<a name="id2700818" href="#ftn.id2700818" class="footnote">188</a>]</sup>

</p><p>

Think practically about the consequence of this extension&#8212;practically,
as a businessperson, and not as a lawyer eager for more legal work. In 1930,
10,047 books were published. In 2000, 174 of those books were still in
print. Let's say you were Brewster Kahle, and you wanted to make available
to the world in your iArchive project the remaining 9,873. What would you
have to do?
</p><p>
Well, first, you'd have to determine which of the 9,873 books were still
under copyright. That requires going to a library (these data are not
on-line) and paging through tomes of books, cross-checking the titles and
authors of the 9,873 books with the copyright registration and renewal
records for works published in 1930. That will produce a list of books still
under copyright.
</p><p>
Then for the books still under copyright, you would need to locate the
current copyright owners. How would you do that?
</p><p>
Most people think that there must be a list of these copyright owners
somewhere. Practical people think this way. How could there be thousands and
thousands of government monopolies without there being at least a list?
</p><p>
But there is no list. There may be a name from 1930, and then in 1959, of
the person who registered the copyright. But just think practically about
how impossibly difficult it would be to track down thousands of such
records&#8212;especially since the person who registered is not necessarily
the current owner. And we're just talking about 1930!
</p><p>
"But there isn't a list of who owns property generally," the apologists for
the system respond. "Why should there be a list of copyright owners?"
</p><p>
Well, actually, if you think about it, there <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> plenty
of lists of who owns what property. Think about deeds on houses, or titles
to cars.  And where there isn't a list, the code of real space is pretty
good at suggesting who the owner of a bit of property is. (A swing set in
your backyard is probably yours.) So formally or informally, we have a
pretty good way to know who owns what tangible property.
</p><p>

So: You walk down a street and see a house. You can know who owns the house
by looking it up in the courthouse registry. If you see a car, there is
ordinarily a license plate that will link the owner to the car. If you see a
bunch of children's toys sitting on the front lawn of a house, it's fairly
easy to determine who owns the toys. And if you happen to see a baseball
lying in a gutter on the side of the road, look around for a second for some
kids playing ball. If you don't see any kids, then okay: Here's a bit of
property whose owner we can't easily determine. It is the exception that
proves the rule: that we ordinarily know quite well who owns what property.
</p><p>
Compare this story to intangible property. You go into a library.  The
library owns the books. But who owns the copyrights? As I've already
described, there's no list of copyright owners. There are authors' names, of
course, but their copyrights could have been assigned, or passed down in an
estate like Grandma's old jewelry. To know who owns what, you would have to
hire a private detective. The bottom line: The owner cannot easily be
located. And in a regime like ours, in which it is a felony to use such
property without the property owner's permission, the property isn't going
to be used.
</p><p>
The consequence with respect to old books is that they won't be digitized,
and hence will simply rot away on shelves. But the consequence for other
creative works is much more dire.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2700951"></a><p>
Consider the story of Michael Agee, chairman of Hal Roach Studios, which
owns the copyrights for the Laurel and Hardy films. Agee is a direct
beneficiary of the Bono Act. The Laurel and Hardy films were made between
1921 and 1951. Only one of these films, <em class="citetitle">The Lucky
Dog</em>, is currently out of copyright. But for the CTEA, films made
after 1923 would have begun entering the public domain. Because Agee
controls the exclusive rights for these popular films, he makes a great deal
of money. According to one estimate, "Roach has sold about 60,000
videocassettes and 50,000 DVDs of the duo's silent films."<sup>[<a name="id2700973" href="#ftn.id2700973" class="footnote">189</a>]</sup> <a class="indexterm" name="id2700989"></a>
</p><p>
Yet Agee opposed the CTEA. His reasons demonstrate a rare virtue in this
culture: selflessness. He argued in a brief before the Supreme Court that
the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act will, if left standing, destroy
a whole generation of American film.
</p><p>

His argument is straightforward. A tiny fraction of this work has any
continuing commercial value. The rest&#8212;to the extent it survives at
all&#8212;sits in vaults gathering dust. It may be that some of this work
not now commercially valuable will be deemed to be valuable by the owners of
the vaults. For this to occur, however, the commercial benefit from the work
must exceed the costs of making the work available for distribution.
</p><p>
We can't know the benefits, but we do know a lot about the costs.  For most
of the history of film, the costs of restoring film were very high; digital
technology has lowered these costs substantially. While it cost more than
$10,000 to restore a ninety-minute black-and-white film in 1993, it can now
cost as little as $100 to digitize one hour of mm film.<sup>[<a name="id2701026" href="#ftn.id2701026" class="footnote">190</a>]</sup>

</p><p>
Restoration technology is not the only cost, nor the most important.
Lawyers, too, are a cost, and increasingly, a very important one. In
addition to preserving the film, a distributor needs to secure the rights.
And to secure the rights for a film that is under copyright, you need to
locate the copyright owner.
</p><p>
Or more accurately, <span class="emphasis"><em>owners</em></span>. As we've seen, there isn't
only a single copyright associated with a film; there are many. There isn't
a single person whom you can contact about those copyrights; there are as
many as can hold the rights, which turns out to be an extremely large
number. Thus the costs of clearing the rights to these films is
exceptionally high.
</p><p>
"But can't you just restore the film, distribute it, and then pay the
copyright owner when she shows up?" Sure, if you want to commit a
felony. And even if you're not worried about committing a felony, when she
does show up, she'll have the right to sue you for all the profits you have
made. So, if you're successful, you can be fairly confident you'll be
getting a call from someone's lawyer. And if you're not successful, you
won't make enough to cover the costs of your own lawyer. Either way, you
have to talk to a lawyer. And as is too often the case, saying you have to
talk to a lawyer is the same as saying you won't make any money.
</p><p>

For some films, the benefit of releasing the film may well exceed these
costs. But for the vast majority of them, there is no way the benefit would
outweigh the legal costs. Thus, for the vast majority of old films, Agee
argued, the film will not be restored and distributed until the copyright
expires.
</p><p>
But by the time the copyright for these films expires, the film will have
expired. These films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and nitrate stock
dissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal canisters in which
they are now stored will be filled with nothing more than dust.
</p><p>
Of all the creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny fraction has
continuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the copyright is a
crucially important legal device. For that tiny fraction, the copyright
creates incentives to produce and distribute the creative work. For that
tiny fraction, the copyright acts as an "engine of free expression."
</p><p>
But even for that tiny fraction, the actual time during which the creative
work has a commercial life is extremely short. As I've indicated, most books
go out of print within one year. The same is true of music and
film. Commercial culture is sharklike. It must keep moving.  And when a
creative work falls out of favor with the commercial distributors, the
commercial life ends.
</p><p>
Yet that doesn't mean the life of the creative work ends. We don't keep
libraries of books in order to compete with Barnes &amp; Noble, and we don't
have archives of films because we expect people to choose between spending
Friday night watching new movies and spending Friday night watching a 1930
news documentary. The noncommercial life of culture is important and
valuable&#8212;for entertainment but also, and more importantly, for
knowledge. To understand who we are, and where we came from, and how we have
made the mistakes that we have, we need to have access to this history.
</p><p>

Copyrights in this context do not drive an engine of free expression.  In
this context, there is no need for an exclusive right. Copyrights in this
context do no good.
</p><p>
Yet, for most of our history, they also did little harm. For most of our
history, when a work ended its commercial life, there was no
<span class="emphasis"><em>copyright-related use</em></span> that would be inhibited by an
exclusive right.  When a book went out of print, you could not buy it from a
publisher.  But you could still buy it from a used book store, and when a
used book store sells it, in America, at least, there is no need to pay the
copyright owner anything. Thus, the ordinary use of a book after its
commercial life ended was a use that was independent of copyright law.
</p><p>
The same was effectively true of film. Because the costs of restoring a
film&#8212;the real economic costs, not the lawyer costs&#8212;were so high,
it was never at all feasible to preserve or restore film. Like the remains
of a great dinner, when it's over, it's over. Once a film passed out of its
commercial life, it may have been archived for a bit, but that was the end
of its life so long as the market didn't have more to offer.
</p><p>
In other words, though copyright has been relatively short for most of our
history, long copyrights wouldn't have mattered for the works that lost
their commercial value. Long copyrights for these works would not have
interfered with anything.
</p><p>
But this situation has now changed.
</p><p>
One crucially important consequence of the emergence of digital technologies
is to enable the archive that Brewster Kahle dreams of.  Digital
technologies now make it possible to preserve and give access to all sorts
of knowledge. Once a book goes out of print, we can now imagine digitizing
it and making it available to everyone, forever. Once a film goes out of
distribution, we could digitize it and make it available to everyone,
forever. Digital technologies give new life to copyrighted material after it
passes out of its commercial life. It is now possible to preserve and assure
universal access to this knowledge and culture, whereas before it was not.
</p><p>


And now copyright law does get in the way. Every step of producing this
digital archive of our culture infringes on the exclusive right of
copyright. To digitize a book is to copy it. To do that requires permission
of the copyright owner. The same with music, film, or any other aspect of
our culture protected by copyright. The effort to make these things
available to history, or to researchers, or to those who just want to
explore, is now inhibited by a set of rules that were written for a
radically different context.
</p><p>
Here is the core of the harm that comes from extending terms: Now that
technology enables us to rebuild the library of Alexandria, the law gets in
the way. And it doesn't get in the way for any useful
<span class="emphasis"><em>copyright</em></span> purpose, for the purpose of copyright is to
enable the commercial market that spreads culture. No, we are talking about
culture after it has lived its commercial life. In this context, copyright
is serving no purpose <span class="emphasis"><em>at all</em></span> related to the spread of
knowledge. In this context, copyright is not an engine of free
expression. Copyright is a brake.
</p><p>
You may well ask, "But if digital technologies lower the costs for Brewster
Kahle, then they will lower the costs for Random House, too.  So won't
Random House do as well as Brewster Kahle in spreading culture widely?"
</p><p>
Maybe. Someday. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that
publishers would be as complete as libraries. If Barnes &amp; Noble offered
to lend books from its stores for a low price, would that eliminate the need
for libraries? Only if you think that the only role of a library is to serve
what "the market" would demand. But if you think the role of a library is
bigger than this&#8212;if you think its role is to archive culture, whether
there's a demand for any particular bit of that culture or not&#8212;then we
can't count on the commercial market to do our library work for us.
</p><p>
I would be the first to agree that it should do as much as it can: We should
rely upon the market as much as possible to spread and enable culture. My
message is absolutely not antimarket. But where we see the market is not
doing the job, then we should allow nonmarket forces the freedom to fill the
gaps. As one researcher calculated for American culture, 94 percent of the
films, books, and music produced between and 1946 is not commercially
available. However much you love the commercial market, if access is a
value, then 6 percent is a failure to provide that value.<sup>[<a name="id2701263" href="#ftn.id2701263" class="footnote">191</a>]</sup>

</p><p>
In January 1999, we filed a lawsuit on Eric Eldred's behalf in federal
district court in Washington, D.C., asking the court to declare the Sonny
Bono Copyright Term Extension Act unconstitutional. The two central claims
that we made were (1) that extending existing terms violated the
Constitution's "limited Times" requirement, and (2) that extending terms by
another twenty years violated the First Amendment.
</p><p>
The district court dismissed our claims without even hearing an argument.  A
panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also dismissed our
claims, though after hearing an extensive argument. But that decision at
least had a dissent, by one of the most conservative judges on that
court. That dissent gave our claims life.
</p><p>
Judge David Sentelle said the CTEA violated the requirement that copyrights
be for "limited Times" only. His argument was as elegant as it was simple:
If Congress can extend existing terms, then there is no "stopping point" to
Congress's power under the Copyright Clause. The power to extend existing
terms means Congress is not required to grant terms that are "limited."
Thus, Judge Sentelle argued, the court had to interpret the term "limited
Times" to give it meaning. And the best interpretation, Judge Sentelle
argued, would be to deny Congress the power to extend existing terms.
</p><p>
We asked the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as a whole to hear the
case. Cases are ordinarily heard in panels of three, except for important
cases or cases that raise issues specific to the circuit as a whole, where
the court will sit "en banc" to hear the case.
</p><p>

The Court of Appeals rejected our request to hear the case en banc.  This
time, Judge Sentelle was joined by the most liberal member of the
D.C. Circuit, Judge David Tatel. Both the most conservative and the most
liberal judges in the D.C. Circuit believed Congress had overstepped its
bounds.
</p><p>
It was here that most expected Eldred v. Ashcroft would die, for the Supreme
Court rarely reviews any decision by a court of appeals. (It hears about one
hundred cases a year, out of more than five thousand appeals.) And it
practically never reviews a decision that upholds a statute when no other
court has yet reviewed the statute.
</p><p>
But in February 2002, the Supreme Court surprised the world by granting our
petition to review the D.C. Circuit opinion. Argument was set for October of
2002. The summer would be spent writing briefs and preparing for argument.
</p><p>
It is over a year later as I write these words. It is still astonishingly
hard. If you know anything at all about this story, you know that we lost
the appeal. And if you know something more than just the minimum, you
probably think there was no way this case could have been won. After our
defeat, I received literally thousands of missives by well-wishers and
supporters, thanking me for my work on behalf of this noble but doomed
cause. And none from this pile was more significant to me than the e-mail
from my client, Eric Eldred.
</p><p>
Men min klient og disse vennene tok feil. Denne saken kunne vært vunnet. Det
burde ha vært vunnet.  Og uansett hvor hardt jeg prøver å fortelle den
historien til meg selv, kan jeg aldri unnslippe troen på at det er min feil
at vi ikke vant.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2701392"></a><p>

Feil ble gjort tidlig, skjønt den ble først åpenbart på slutten. Vår sak
hadde støtte hos en ekstraordinær advokat, Geoffrey Stewart, helt fra
starten, og hos advokatfirmaet hadde han flyttet til, Jones, Day, Reavis og
Pogue. Jones Day mottok mye press fra sine opphavsrettsbeskyttende klienter
på grunn av sin støtte til oss.  De ignorert dette presset (noe veldig få
advokatfirmaer noen sinne ville gjøre), og ga alt de hadde gjennom hele
saken.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2701415"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2701421"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2701427"></a><p>
Det var tre viktige advokater på saken fra Jones DaY. Geoff Stewart var den
først, men siden ble Dan Bromberg og Don Ayer ganske involvert. Bromberg og
Ayer spesielt hadde en felles oppfatning om hvordan denne saken ville bli
vunnet: vi ville bare vinne, fortalte de gjentatte ganger til meg, hvis vi
få problemet til å virke "viktig" for Høyesterett. Det måtte synes som om
dramatisk skade ble gjort til ytringsfriheten og fri kultur, ellers ville de
aldri stemt mot "de mektigste mediaselskapene i verden".
</p><p>
I hate this view of the law. Of course I thought the Sonny Bono Act was a
dramatic harm to free speech and free culture. Of course I still think it
is. But the idea that the Supreme Court decides the law based on how
important they believe the issues are is just wrong. It might be "right" as
in "true," I thought, but it is "wrong" as in "it just shouldn't be that
way." As I believed that any faithful interpretation of what the framers of
our Constitution did would yield the conclusion that the CTEA was
unconstitutional, and as I believed that any faithful interpretation of what
the First Amendment means would yield the conclusion that the power to
extend existing copyright terms is unconstitutional, I was not persuaded
that we had to sell our case like soap.  Just as a law that bans the
swastika is unconstitutional not because the Court likes Nazis but because
such a law would violate the Constitution, so too, in my view, would the
Court decide whether Congress's law was constitutional based on the
Constitution, not based on whether they liked the values that the framers
put in the Constitution.
</p><p>
In any case, I thought, the Court must already see the danger and the harm
caused by this sort of law. Why else would they grant review? There was no
reason to hear the case in the Supreme Court if they weren't convinced that
this regulation was harmful. So in my view, we didn't need to persuade them
that this law was bad, we needed to show why it was unconstitutional.
</p><p>

There was one way, however, in which I felt politics would matter and in
which I thought a response was appropriate. I was convinced that the Court
would not hear our arguments if it thought these were just the arguments of
a group of lefty loons. This Supreme Court was not about to launch into a
new field of judicial review if it seemed that this field of review was
simply the preference of a small political minority.  Although my focus in
the case was not to demonstrate how bad the Sonny Bono Act was but to
demonstrate that it was unconstitutional, my hope was to make this argument
against a background of briefs that covered the full range of political
views. To show that this claim against the CTEA was grounded in
<span class="emphasis"><em>law</em></span> and not politics, then, we tried to gather the
widest range of credible critics&#8212;credible not because they were rich
and famous, but because they, in the aggregate, demonstrated that this law
was unconstitutional regardless of one's politics.
</p><p>
The first step happened all by itself. Phyllis Schlafly's organization,
Eagle Forum, had been an opponent of the CTEA from the very beginning.
Mrs. Schlafly viewed the CTEA as a sellout by Congress. In November 1998,
she wrote a stinging editorial attacking the Republican Congress for
allowing the law to pass. As she wrote, "Do you sometimes wonder why bills
that create a financial windfall to narrow special interests slide easily
through the intricate legislative process, while bills that benefit the
general public seem to get bogged down?" The answer, as the editorial
documented, was the power of money.  Schlafly enumerated Disney's
contributions to the key players on the committees. It was money, not
justice, that gave Mickey Mouse twenty more years in Disney's control,
Schlafly argued.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2701534"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2701540"></a>
</p><p>
In the Court of Appeals, Eagle Forum was eager to file a brief supporting
our position. Their brief made the argument that became the core claim in
the Supreme Court: If Congress can extend the term of existing copyrights,
there is no limit to Congress's power to set terms.  That strong
conservative argument persuaded a strong conservative judge, Judge Sentelle.
</p><p>
In the Supreme Court, the briefs on our side were about as diverse as it
gets. They included an extraordinary historical brief by the Free Software
Foundation (home of the GNU project that made GNU/ Linux possible). They
included a powerful brief about the costs of uncertainty by Intel. There
were two law professors' briefs, one by copyright scholars and one by First
Amendment scholars. There was an exhaustive and uncontroverted brief by the
world's experts in the history of the Progress Clause. And of course, there
was a new brief by Eagle Forum, repeating and strengthening its arguments.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2701569"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2701578"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2701584"></a>
</p><p>
Those briefs framed a legal argument. Then to support the legal argument,
there were a number of powerful briefs by libraries and archives, including
the Internet Archive, the American Association of Law Libraries, and the
National Writers Union.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2701598"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2701605"></a>
</p><p>
But two briefs captured the policy argument best. One made the argument I've
already described: A brief by Hal Roach Studios argued that unless the law
was struck, a whole generation of American film would disappear. The other
made the economic argument absolutely clear.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2701620"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2701626"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2701632"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2701639"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2701645"></a><p>
This economists' brief was signed by seventeen economists, including five
Nobel Prize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan, Milton
Friedman, Kenneth Arrow, and George Akerlof. The economists, as the list of
Nobel winners demonstrates, spanned the political spectrum. Their
conclusions were powerful: There was no plausible claim that extending the
terms of existing copyrights would do anything to increase incentives to
create. Such extensions were nothing more than "rent-seeking"&#8212;the
fancy term economists use to describe special-interest legislation gone
wild.
</p><p>
The same effort at balance was reflected in the legal team we gathered to
write our briefs in the case. The Jones Day lawyers had been with us from
the start. But when the case got to the Supreme Court, we added three
lawyers to help us frame this argument to this Court: Alan Morrison, a
lawyer from Public Citizen, a Washington group that had made constitutional
history with a series of seminal victories in the Supreme Court defending
individual rights; my colleague and dean, Kathleen Sullivan, who had argued
many cases in the Court, and who had advised us early on about a First
Amendment strategy; and finally, former solicitor general Charles Fried.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2701655"></a>
</p><p>
Fried was a special victory for our side. Every other former solicitor
general was hired by the other side to defend Congress's power to give media
companies the special favor of extended copyright terms. Fried was the only
one who turned down that lucrative assignment to stand up for something he
believed in. He had been Ronald Reagan's chief lawyer in the Supreme
Court. He had helped craft the line of cases that limited Congress's power
in the context of the Commerce Clause. And while he had argued many
positions in the Supreme Court that I personally disagreed with, his joining
the cause was a vote of confidence in our argument.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2701701"></a>
</p><p>
The government, in defending the statute, had its collection of friends, as
well. Significantly, however, none of these "friends" included historians or
economists. The briefs on the other side of the case were written
exclusively by major media companies, congressmen, and copyright holders.
</p><p>
The media companies were not surprising. They had the most to gain from the
law. The congressmen were not surprising either&#8212;they were defending
their power and, indirectly, the gravy train of contributions such power
induced. And of course it was not surprising that the copyright holders
would defend the idea that they should continue to have the right to control
who did what with content they wanted to control.
</p><p>
Dr. Seuss's representatives, for example, argued that it was better for the
Dr. Seuss estate to control what happened to Dr. Seuss's work&#8212; better
than allowing it to fall into the public domain&#8212;because if this
creativity were in the public domain, then people could use it to "glorify
drugs or to create pornography."<sup>[<a name="id2701731" href="#ftn.id2701731" class="footnote">192</a>]</sup> That
was also the motive of the Gershwin estate, which defended its "protection"
of the work of George Gershwin. They refuse, for example, to license
<em class="citetitle">Porgy and Bess</em> to anyone who refuses to use African
Americans in the cast.<sup>[<a name="id2701756" href="#ftn.id2701756" class="footnote">193</a>]</sup> That's their
view of how this part of American culture should be controlled, and they
wanted this law to help them effect that control.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2701770"></a>
</p><p>
This argument made clear a theme that is rarely noticed in this debate.
When Congress decides to extend the term of existing copyrights, Congress is
making a choice about which speakers it will favor.  Famous and beloved
copyright owners, such as the Gershwin estate and Dr. Seuss, come to
Congress and say, "Give us twenty years to control the speech about these
icons of American culture. We'll do better with them than anyone else."
Congress of course likes to reward the popular and famous by giving them
what they want. But when Congress gives people an exclusive right to speak
in a certain way, that's just what the First Amendment is traditionally
meant to block.
</p><p>
We argued as much in a final brief. Not only would upholding the CTEA mean
that there was no limit to the power of Congress to extend
copyrights&#8212;extensions that would further concentrate the market; it
would also mean that there was no limit to Congress's power to play
favorites, through copyright, with who has the right to speak.  Between
February and October, there was little I did beyond preparing for this
case. Early on, as I said, I set the strategy.
</p><p>
The Supreme Court was divided into two important camps. One camp we called
"the Conservatives." The other we called "the Rest." The Conservatives
included Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice
Kennedy, and Justice Thomas. These five had been the most consistent in
limiting Congress's power. They were the five who had supported the
<em class="citetitle">Lopez/Morrison</em> line of cases that said that an
enumerated power had to be interpreted to assure that Congress's powers had
limits.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2701820"></a><p>

The Rest were the four Justices who had strongly opposed limits on
Congress's power. These four&#8212;Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer&#8212;had repeatedly argued that the
Constitution gives Congress broad discretion to decide how best to implement
its powers. In case after case, these justices had argued that the Court's
role should be one of deference. Though the votes of these four justices
were the votes that I personally had most consistently agreed with, they
were also the votes that we were least likely to get.
</p><p>
In particular, the least likely was Justice Ginsburg's. In addition to her
general view about deference to Congress (except where issues of gender are
involved), she had been particularly deferential in the context of
intellectual property protections. She and her daughter (an excellent and
well-known intellectual property scholar) were cut from the same
intellectual property cloth. We expected she would agree with the writings
of her daughter: that Congress had the power in this context to do as it
wished, even if what Congress wished made little sense.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2701854"></a><p>
Close behind Justice Ginsburg were two justices whom we also viewed as
unlikely allies, though possible surprises. Justice Souter strongly favored
deference to Congress, as did Justice Breyer. But both were also very
sensitive to free speech concerns. And as we strongly believed, there was a
very important free speech argument against these retrospective extensions.
</p><p>
The only vote we could be confident about was that of Justice
Stevens. History will record Justice Stevens as one of the greatest judges
on this Court. His votes are consistently eclectic, which just means that no
simple ideology explains where he will stand. But he had consistently argued
for limits in the context of intellectual property generally. We were fairly
confident he would recognize limits here.
</p><p>
This analysis of "the Rest" showed most clearly where our focus had to be:
on the Conservatives. To win this case, we had to crack open these five and
get at least a majority to go our way. Thus, the single overriding argument
that animated our claim rested on the Conservatives' most important
jurisprudential innovation&#8212;the argument that Judge Sentelle had relied
upon in the Court of Appeals, that Congress's power must be interpreted so
that its enumerated powers have limits.
</p><p>

This then was the core of our strategy&#8212;a strategy for which I am
responsible. We would get the Court to see that just as with the
<em class="citetitle">Lopez</em> case, under the government's argument here,
Congress would always have unlimited power to extend existing terms. If
anything was plain about Congress's power under the Progress Clause, it was
that this power was supposed to be "limited." Our aim would be to get the
Court to reconcile <em class="citetitle">Eldred</em> with
<em class="citetitle">Lopez</em>: If Congress's power to regulate commerce was
limited, then so, too, must Congress's power to regulate copyright be
limited.
</p><p>
The argument on the government's side came down to this: Congress has done
it before. It should be allowed to do it again. The government claimed that
from the very beginning, Congress has been extending the term of existing
copyrights. So, the government argued, the Court should not now say that
practice is unconstitutional.
</p><p>
There was some truth to the government's claim, but not much. We certainly
agreed that Congress had extended existing terms in and in 1909. And of
course, in 1962, Congress began extending existing terms
regularly&#8212;eleven times in forty years.
</p><p>

But this "consistency" should be kept in perspective. Congress extended
existing terms once in the first hundred years of the Republic.  It then
extended existing terms once again in the next fifty. Those rare extensions
are in contrast to the now regular practice of extending existing
terms. Whatever restraint Congress had had in the past, that restraint was
now gone. Congress was now in a cycle of extensions; there was no reason to
expect that cycle would end. This Court had not hesitated to intervene where
Congress was in a similar cycle of extension.  There was no reason it
couldn't intervene here.  Oral argument was scheduled for the first week in
October. I arrived in D.C. two weeks before the argument. During those two
weeks, I was repeatedly "mooted" by lawyers who had volunteered to help in
the case. Such "moots" are basically practice rounds, where wannabe justices
fire questions at wannabe winners.
</p><p>
I was convinced that to win, I had to keep the Court focused on a single
point: that if this extension is permitted, then there is no limit to the
power to set terms. Going with the government would mean that terms would be
effectively unlimited; going with us would give Congress a clear line to
follow: Don't extend existing terms. The moots were an effective practice; I
found ways to take every question back to this central idea.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2701972"></a><p>
One moot was before the lawyers at Jones Day. Don Ayer was the skeptic. He
had served in the Reagan Justice Department with Solicitor General Charles
Fried. He had argued many cases before the Supreme Court. And in his review
of the moot, he let his concern speak: <a class="indexterm" name="id2701985"></a>
</p><p>
"I'm just afraid that unless they really see the harm, they won't be willing
to upset this practice that the government says has been a consistent
practice for two hundred years. You have to make them see the
harm&#8212;passionately get them to see the harm. For if they don't see
that, then we haven't any chance of winning."
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2701994"></a><p>

He may have argued many cases before this Court, I thought, but he didn't
understand its soul. As a clerk, I had seen the Justices do the right
thing&#8212;not because of politics but because it was right. As a law
professor, I had spent my life teaching my students that this Court does the
right thing&#8212;not because of politics but because it is right. As I
listened to Ayer's plea for passion in pressing politics, I understood his
point, and I rejected it. Our argument was right. That was enough.  Let the
politicians learn to see that it was also good.  The night before the
argument, a line of people began to form in front of the Supreme Court. The
case had become a focus of the press and of the movement to free
culture. Hundreds stood in line for the chance to see the
proceedings. Scores spent the night on the Supreme Court steps so that they
would be assured a seat.
</p><p>
Not everyone has to wait in line. People who know the Justices can ask for
seats they control. (I asked Justice Scalia's chambers for seats for my
parents, for example.) Members of the Supreme Court bar can get a seat in a
special section reserved for them. And senators and congressmen have a
special place where they get to sit, too. And finally, of course, the press
has a gallery, as do clerks working for the Justices on the Court. As we
entered that morning, there was no place that was not taken. This was an
argument about intellectual property law, yet the halls were filled. As I
walked in to take my seat at the front of the Court, I saw my parents
sitting on the left. As I sat down at the table, I saw Jack Valenti sitting
in the special section ordinarily reserved for family of the Justices.
</p><p>
When the Chief Justice called me to begin my argument, I began where I
intended to stay: on the question of the limits on Congress's power. This
was a case about enumerated powers, I said, and whether those enumerated
powers had any limit.
</p><p>
Justice O'Connor stopped me within one minute of my opening.  The history
was bothering her.
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
justice o'connor: Congress has extended the term so often through the years,
and if you are right, don't we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions
of time? I mean, this seems to be a practice that began with the very first
act.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
She was quite willing to concede "that this flies directly in the face of
what the framers had in mind." But my response again and again was to
emphasize limits on Congress's power.
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

mr. lessig: Well, if it flies in the face of what the framers had in mind,
then the question is, is there a way of interpreting their words that gives
effect to what they had in mind, and the answer is yes.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
There were two points in this argument when I should have seen where the
Court was going. The first was a question by Justice Kennedy, who observed,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
justice kennedy: Well, I suppose implicit in the argument that the '76 act,
too, should have been declared void, and that we might leave it alone
because of the disruption, is that for all these years the act has impeded
progress in science and the useful arts.  I just don't see any empirical
evidence for that.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Here follows my clear mistake. Like a professor correcting a student, I
answered,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
mr. lessig: Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all.  Nothing
in our Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about
impeding progress. Our only argument is this is a structural limit necessary
to assure that what would be an effectively perpetual term not be permitted
under the copyright laws.
</p></blockquote></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2702135"></a><p>
That was a correct answer, but it wasn't the right answer. The right answer
was instead that there was an obvious and profound harm. Any number of
briefs had been written about it. He wanted to hear it. And here was the
place Don Ayer's advice should have mattered. This was a softball; my answer
was a swing and a miss.
</p><p>
The second came from the Chief, for whom the whole case had been
crafted. For the Chief Justice had crafted the <em class="citetitle">Lopez</em>
ruling, and we hoped that he would see this case as its second cousin.
</p><p>

It was clear a second into his question that he wasn't at all sympathetic.
To him, we were a bunch of anarchists. As he asked:


</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
chief justice: Well, but you want more than that. You want the right to copy
verbatim other people's books, don't you?
</p><p>
mr. lessig: We want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in the
public domain and would be in the public domain but for a statute that
cannot be justified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under a
proper reading of the limits built into the Copyright Clause.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Things went better for us when the government gave its argument; for now the
Court picked up on the core of our claim. As Justice Scalia asked Solicitor
General Olson,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
justice scalia: You say that the functional equivalent of an unlimited time
would be a violation [of the Constitution], but that's precisely the
argument that's being made by petitioners here, that a limited time which is
extendable is the functional equivalent of an unlimited time.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
When Olson was finished, it was my turn to give a closing rebuttal.  Olson's
flailing had revived my anger. But my anger still was directed to the
academic, not the practical. The government was arguing as if this were the
first case ever to consider limits on Congress's Copyright and Patent Clause
power. Ever the professor and not the advocate, I closed by pointing out the
long history of the Court imposing limits on Congress's power in the name of
the Copyright and Patent Clause&#8212; indeed, the very first case striking
a law of Congress as exceeding a specific enumerated power was based upon
the Copyright and Patent Clause. All true. But it wasn't going to move the
Court to my side.
</p><p>

As I left the court that day, I knew there were a hundred points I wished I
could remake. There were a hundred questions I wished I had answered
differently. But one way of thinking about this case left me optimistic.
</p><p>
The government had been asked over and over again, what is the limit? Over
and over again, it had answered there is no limit. This was precisely the
answer I wanted the Court to hear. For I could not imagine how the Court
could understand that the government believed Congress's power was unlimited
under the terms of the Copyright Clause, and sustain the government's
argument. The solicitor general had made my argument for me. No matter how
often I tried, I could not understand how the Court could find that
Congress's power under the Commerce Clause was limited, but under the
Copyright Clause, unlimited. In those rare moments when I let myself believe
that we may have prevailed, it was because I felt this Court&#8212;in
particular, the Conservatives&#8212;would feel itself constrained by the
rule of law that it had established elsewhere.
</p><p>
The morning of January 15, 2003, I was five minutes late to the office and
missed the 7:00 A.M. call from the Supreme Court clerk. Listening to the
message, I could tell in an instant that she had bad news to report.The
Supreme Court had affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Seven
justices had voted in the majority. There were two dissents.
</p><p>
A few seconds later, the opinions arrived by e-mail. I took the phone off
the hook, posted an announcement to our blog, and sat down to see where I
had been wrong in my reasoning.
</p><p>
My <span class="emphasis"><em>reasoning</em></span>. Here was a case that pitted all the money
in the world against <span class="emphasis"><em>reasoning</em></span>. And here was the last
naïve law professor, scouring the pages, looking for reasoning.
</p><p>
I first scoured the opinion, looking for how the Court would distinguish the
principle in this case from the principle in
<em class="citetitle">Lopez</em>. The argument was nowhere to be found. The case
was not even cited. The argument that was the core argument of our case did
not even appear in the Court's opinion.
</p><p>



Justice Ginsburg simply ignored the enumerated powers argument.  Consistent
with her view that Congress's power was not limited generally, she had found
Congress's power not limited here.
</p><p>
Her opinion was perfectly reasonable&#8212;for her, and for Justice
Souter. Neither believes in <em class="citetitle">Lopez</em>. It would be too
much to expect them to write an opinion that recognized, much less
explained, the doctrine they had worked so hard to defeat.
</p><p>
But as I realized what had happened, I couldn't quite believe what I was
reading. I had said there was no way this Court could reconcile limited
powers with the Commerce Clause and unlimited powers with the Progress
Clause. It had never even occurred to me that they could reconcile the two
simply <span class="emphasis"><em>by not addressing the argument</em></span>. There was no
inconsistency because they would not talk about the two together.  There was
therefore no principle that followed from the <em class="citetitle">Lopez</em>
case: In that context, Congress's power would be limited, but in this
context it would not.
</p><p>
Yet by what right did they get to choose which of the framers' values they
would respect? By what right did they&#8212;the silent five&#8212;get to
select the part of the Constitution they would enforce based on the values
they thought important? We were right back to the argument that I said I
hated at the start: I had failed to convince them that the issue here was
important, and I had failed to recognize that however much I might hate a
system in which the Court gets to pick the constitutional values that it
will respect, that is the system we have.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702325"></a><p>
Justices Breyer and Stevens wrote very strong dissents. Stevens's opinion
was crafted internal to the law: He argued that the tradition of
intellectual property law should not support this unjustified extension of
terms. He based his argument on a parallel analysis that had governed in the
context of patents (so had we). But the rest of the Court discounted the
parallel&#8212;without explaining how the very same words in the Progress
Clause could come to mean totally different things depending upon whether
the words were about patents or copyrights.  The Court let Justice Stevens's
charge go unanswered.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702344"></a><p>


Justice Breyer's opinion, perhaps the best opinion he has ever written, was
external to the Constitution. He argued that the term of copyrights has
become so long as to be effectively unlimited. We had said that under the
current term, a copyright gave an author 99.8 percent of the value of a
perpetual term. Breyer said we were wrong, that the actual number was
99.9997 percent of a perpetual term. Either way, the point was clear: If the
Constitution said a term had to be "limited," and the existing term was so
long as to be effectively unlimited, then it was unconstitutional.
</p><p>
These two justices understood all the arguments we had made. But because
neither believed in the <em class="citetitle">Lopez</em> case, neither was
willing to push it as a reason to reject this extension. The case was
decided without anyone having addressed the argument that we had carried
from Judge Sentelle. It was <em class="citetitle">Hamlet</em> without the
Prince.
</p><p>
Defeat brings depression. They say it is a sign of health when depression
gives way to anger. My anger came quickly, but it didn't cure the
depression. This anger was of two sorts.
</p><p>
It was first anger with the five "Conservatives." It would have been one
thing for them to have explained why the principle of
<em class="citetitle">Lopez</em> didn't apply in this case. That wouldn't have
been a very convincing argument, I don't believe, having read it made by
others, and having tried to make it myself. But it at least would have been
an act of integrity.  These justices in particular have repeatedly said that
the proper mode of interpreting the Constitution is "originalism"&#8212;to
first understand the framers' text, interpreted in their context, in light
of the structure of the Constitution. That method had produced
<em class="citetitle">Lopez</em> and many other "originalist" rulings. Where was
their "originalism" now?
</p><p>

Here, they had joined an opinion that never once tried to explain what the
framers had meant by crafting the Progress Clause as they did; they joined
an opinion that never once tried to explain how the structure of that clause
would affect the interpretation of Congress's power. And they joined an
opinion that didn't even try to explain why this grant of power could be
unlimited, whereas the Commerce Clause would be limited. In short, they had
joined an opinion that did not apply to, and was inconsistent with, their
own method for interpreting the Constitution. This opinion may well have
yielded a result that they liked. It did not produce a reason that was
consistent with their own principles.
</p><p>
My anger with the Conservatives quickly yielded to anger with myself.  For I
had let a view of the law that I liked interfere with a view of the law as
it is.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702455"></a><p>
Most lawyers, and most law professors, have little patience for idealism
about courts in general and this Supreme Court in particular.  Most have a
much more pragmatic view. When Don Ayer said that this case would be won
based on whether I could convince the Justices that the framers' values were
important, I fought the idea, because I didn't want to believe that that is
how this Court decides. I insisted on arguing this case as if it were a
simple application of a set of principles.  I had an argument that followed
in logic. I didn't need to waste my time showing it should also follow in
popularity.
</p><p>

As I read back over the transcript from that argument in October, I can see
a hundred places where the answers could have taken the conversation in
different directions, where the truth about the harm that this unchecked
power will cause could have been made clear to this Court. Justice Kennedy
in good faith wanted to be shown. I, idiotically, corrected his
question. Justice Souter in good faith wanted to be shown the First
Amendment harms. I, like a math teacher, reframed the question to make the
logical point. I had shown them how they could strike this law of Congress
if they wanted to. There were a hundred places where I could have helped
them want to, yet my stubbornness, my refusal to give in, stopped me. I have
stood before hundreds of audiences trying to persuade; I have used passion
in that effort to persuade; but I refused to stand before this audience and
try to persuade with the passion I had used elsewhere. It was not the basis
on which a court should decide the issue.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702497"></a><p>
Would it have been different if I had argued it differently? Would it have
been different if Don Ayer had argued it? Or Charles Fried? Or Kathleen
Sullivan? <a class="indexterm" name="id2702508"></a>
</p><p>
My friends huddled around me to insist it would not. The Court was not
ready, my friends insisted. This was a loss that was destined. It would take
a great deal more to show our society why our framers were right. And when
we do that, we will be able to show that Court.
</p><p>
Maybe, but I doubt it. These Justices have no financial interest in doing
anything except the right thing. They are not lobbied. They have little
reason to resist doing right. I can't help but think that if I had stepped
down from this pretty picture of dispassionate justice, I could have
persuaded.
</p><p>
And even if I couldn't, then that doesn't excuse what happened in
January. For at the start of this case, one of America's leading
intellectual property professors stated publicly that my bringing this case
was a mistake. "The Court is not ready," Peter Jaszi said; this issue should
not be raised until it is.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2702539"></a>
</p><p>

After the argument and after the decision, Peter said to me, and publicly,
that he was wrong. But if indeed that Court could not have been persuaded,
then that is all the evidence that's needed to know that here again Peter
was right. Either I was not ready to argue this case in a way that would do
some good or they were not ready to hear this case in a way that would do
some good. Either way, the decision to bring this case&#8212;a decision I
had made four years before&#8212;was wrong.  While the reaction to the Sonny
Bono Act itself was almost unanimously negative, the reaction to the Court's
decision was mixed.  No one, at least in the press, tried to say that
extending the term of copyright was a good idea. We had won that battle over
ideas. Where the decision was praised, it was praised by papers that had
been skeptical of the Court's activism in other cases. Deference was a good
thing, even if it left standing a silly law. But where the decision was
attacked, it was attacked because it left standing a silly and harmful
law. <em class="citetitle">The New York Times</em> wrote in its editorial,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In effect, the Supreme Court's decision makes it likely that we are seeing
the beginning of the end of public domain and the birth of copyright
perpetuity. The public domain has been a grand experiment, one that should
not be allowed to die. The ability to draw freely on the entire creative
output of humanity is one of the reasons we live in a time of such fruitful
creative ferment.

The best responses were in the cartoons. There was a gaggle of hilarious
images&#8212;of Mickey in jail and the like. The best, from my view of the
case, was Ruben Bolling's, reproduced on the next page. The "powerful and
wealthy" line is a bit unfair. But the punch in the face felt exactly like
that.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2702412"></a>

The image that will always stick in my head is that evoked by the quote from
<em class="citetitle">The New York Times</em>. That "grand experiment" we call
the "public domain" is over? When I can make light of it, I think, "Honey, I
shrunk the Constitution." But I can rarely make light of it. We had in our
Constitution a commitment to free culture. In the case that I fathered, the
Supreme Court effectively renounced that commitment. A better lawyer would
have made them see differently.

There's a parallel here with pornography that is a bit hard to describe, but
it's a strong one. One phenomenon that the Internet created was a world of
noncommercial pornographers&#8212;people who were distributing porn but were
not making money directly or indirectly from that distribution.  Such a
class didn't exist before the Internet came into being because the costs of
distributing porn were so high. Yet this new class of distributors got
special attention in the Supreme Court, when the Court struck down the
Communications Decency Act of 1996. It was partly because of the burden on
noncommercial speakers that the statute was found to exceed Congress's
power. The same point could have been made about noncommercial publishers
after the advent of the Internet. The Eric Eldreds of the world before the
Internet were extremely few. Yet one would think it at least as important to
protect the Eldreds of the world as to protect noncommercial pornographers.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id2700285" href="#id2700285" class="para">180</a>] </sup>

If it is a principle about enumerated powers, then the principle carries
from one enumerated power to another. The animating point in the context of
the Commerce Clause was that the interpretation offered by the government
would allow the government unending power to regulate commerce&#8212;the
limitation to interstate commerce notwithstanding. The same point is true in
the context of the Copyright Clause. Here, too, the government's
interpretation would allow the government unending power to regulate
copyrights&#8212;the limitation to "limited times" notwithstanding.

The day <em class="citetitle">Eldred</em> was decided, fate would have it that I
was to travel to Washington, D.C. (The day the rehearing petition in
<em class="citetitle">Eldred</em> was denied&#8212;meaning the case was really
finally over&#8212;fate would have it that I was giving a speech to
technologists at Disney World.)  This was a particularly long flight to my
least favorite city. The drive into the city from Dulles was delayed because
of traffic, so I opened up my computer and wrote an op-ed piece.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702637"></a><p>
It was an act of contrition. During the whole of the flight from San
Francisco to Washington, I had heard over and over again in my head the same
advice from Don Ayer: You need to make them see why it is important. And
alternating with that command was the question of Justice Kennedy: "For all
these years the act has impeded progress in science and the useful arts. I
just don't see any empirical evidence for that." And so, having failed in
the argument of constitutional principle, finally, I turned to an argument
of politics.
</p><p>

<em class="citetitle">The New York Times</em> published the piece. In it, I
proposed a simple fix: Fifty years after a work has been published, the
copyright owner would be required to register the work and pay a small
fee. If he paid the fee, he got the benefit of the full term of
copyright. If he did not, the work passed into the public domain.
</p><p>
We called this the Eldred Act, but that was just to give it a name.  Eric
Eldred was kind enough to let his name be used once again, but as he said
early on, it won't get passed unless it has another name.
</p><p>
Or another two names. For depending upon your perspective, this is either
the "Public Domain Enhancement Act" or the "Copyright Term Deregulation
Act." Either way, the essence of the idea is clear and obvious: Remove
copyright where it is doing nothing except blocking access and the spread of
knowledge. Leave it for as long as Congress allows for those works where its
worth is at least $1. But for everything else, let the content go.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702701"></a><p>
The reaction to this idea was amazingly strong. Steve Forbes endorsed it in
an editorial. I received an avalanche of e-mail and letters expressing
support. When you focus the issue on lost creativity, people can see the
copyright system makes no sense. As a good Republican might say, here
government regulation is simply getting in the way of innovation and
creativity. And as a good Democrat might say, here the government is
blocking access and the spread of knowledge for no good reason. Indeed,
there is no real difference between Democrats and Republicans on this
issue. Anyone can recognize the stupid harm of the present system.
</p><p>
Indeed, many recognized the obvious benefit of the registration
requirement.  For one of the hardest things about the current system for
people who want to license content is that there is no obvious place to look
for the current copyright owners. Since registration is not required, since
marking content is not required, since no formality at all is required, it
is often impossibly hard to locate copyright owners to ask permission to use
or license their work. This system would lower these costs, by establishing
at least one registry where copyright owners could be identified.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702734"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2702740"></a><p>

As I described in chapter <a class="xref" href="#property-i" title='Kapittel 11. Kapittel ti: "Eiendom"'>11</a>, formalities in copyright law were removed in 1976,
when Congress followed the Europeans by abandoning any formal requirement
before a copyright is granted.<sup>[<a name="id2702758" href="#ftn.id2702758" class="footnote">194</a>]</sup> The
Europeans are said to view copyright as a "natural right." Natural rights
don't need forms to exist. Traditions, like the Anglo-American tradition
that required copyright owners to follow form if their rights were to be
protected, did not, the Europeans thought, properly respect the dignity of
the author. My right as a creator turns on my creativity, not upon the
special favor of the government.
</p><p>
That's great rhetoric. It sounds wonderfully romantic. But it is absurd
copyright policy. It is absurd especially for authors, because a world
without formalities harms the creator. The ability to spread "Walt Disney
creativity" is destroyed when there is no simple way to know what's
protected and what's not.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702806"></a><p>
The fight against formalities achieved its first real victory in Berlin in
1908. International copyright lawyers amended the Berne Convention in 1908,
to require copyright terms of life plus fifty years, as well as the
abolition of copyright formalities. The formalities were hated because the
stories of inadvertent loss were increasingly common. It was as if a Charles
Dickens character ran all copyright offices, and the failure to dot an
<em class="citetitle">i</em> or cross a <em class="citetitle">t</em> resulted in the
loss of widows' only income.
</p><p>
These complaints were real and sensible. And the strictness of the
formalities, especially in the United States, was absurd. The law should
always have ways of forgiving innocent mistakes. There is no reason
copyright law couldn't, as well. Rather than abandoning formalities totally,
the response in Berlin should have been to embrace a more equitable system
of registration.
</p><p>
Even that would have been resisted, however, because registration in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries was still expensive. It was also a
hassle. The abolishment of formalities promised not only to save the
starving widows, but also to lighten an unnecessary regulatory burden
imposed upon creators.
</p><p>

In addition to the practical complaint of authors in 1908, there was a moral
claim as well. There was no reason that creative property should be a
second-class form of property. If a carpenter builds a table, his rights
over the table don't depend upon filing a form with the government.  He has
a property right over the table "naturally," and he can assert that right
against anyone who would steal the table, whether or not he has informed the
government of his ownership of the table.
</p><p>
This argument is correct, but its implications are misleading. For the
argument in favor of formalities does not depend upon creative property
being second-class property. The argument in favor of formalities turns upon
the special problems that creative property presents.  The law of
formalities responds to the special physics of creative property, to assure
that it can be efficiently and fairly spread.
</p><p>
No one thinks, for example, that land is second-class property just because
you have to register a deed with a court if your sale of land is to be
effective. And few would think a car is second-class property just because
you must register the car with the state and tag it with a license.  In both
of those cases, everyone sees that there is an important reason to secure
registration&#8212;both because it makes the markets more efficient and
because it better secures the rights of the owner. Without a registration
system for land, landowners would perpetually have to guard their
property. With registration, they can simply point the police to a
deed. Without a registration system for cars, auto theft would be much
easier. With a registration system, the thief has a high burden to sell a
stolen car. A slight burden is placed on the property owner, but those
burdens produce a much better system of protection for property generally.
</p><p>
It is similarly special physics that makes formalities important in
copyright law. Unlike a carpenter's table, there's nothing in nature that
makes it relatively obvious who might own a particular bit of creative
property. A recording of Lyle Lovett's latest album can exist in a billion
places without anything necessarily linking it back to a particular
owner. And like a car, there's no way to buy and sell creative property with
confidence unless there is some simple way to authenticate who is the author
and what rights he has. Simple transactions are destroyed in a world without
formalities. Complex, expensive, <span class="emphasis"><em>lawyer</em></span> transactions
take their place.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2702908"></a>
</p><p>
This was the understanding of the problem with the Sonny Bono Act that we
tried to demonstrate to the Court. This was the part it didn't "get."
Because we live in a system without formalities, there is no way easily to
build upon or use culture from our past. If copyright terms were, as Justice
Story said they would be, "short," then this wouldn't matter much. For
fourteen years, under the framers' system, a work would be presumptively
controlled. After fourteen years, it would be presumptively uncontrolled.
</p><p>
But now that copyrights can be just about a century long, the inability to
know what is protected and what is not protected becomes a huge and obvious
burden on the creative process. If the only way a library can offer an
Internet exhibit about the New Deal is to hire a lawyer to clear the rights
to every image and sound, then the copyright system is burdening creativity
in a way that has never been seen before <span class="emphasis"><em>because there are no
formalities</em></span>.
</p><p>
The Eldred Act was designed to respond to exactly this problem. If it is
worth $1 to you, then register your work and you can get the longer
term. Others will know how to contact you and, therefore, how to get your
permission if they want to use your work. And you will get the benefit of an
extended copyright term.
</p><p>
If it isn't worth it to you to register to get the benefit of an extended
term, then it shouldn't be worth it for the government to defend your
monopoly over that work either. The work should pass into the public domain
where anyone can copy it, or build archives with it, or create a movie based
on it. It should become free if it is not worth $1 to you.
</p><p>
Noen bekymrer seg over byrden på forfattere. Gjør ikke byrden med å
registrere verket at beløpet $1 egentlig er misvisende?  Er ikke
ekstraarbeidet verdt mer enn $1? Er ikke dette det virkelige problemet med
registrering?
</p><p>

It is. The hassle is terrible. The system that exists now is awful. I
completely agree that the Copyright Office has done a terrible job (no doubt
because they are terribly funded) in enabling simple and cheap
registrations. Any real solution to the problem of formalities must address
the real problem of <span class="emphasis"><em>governments</em></span> standing at the core of
any system of formalities. In this book, I offer such a solution. That
solution essentially remakes the Copyright Office. For now, assume it was
Amazon that ran the registration system. Assume it was one-click
registration.  The Eldred Act would propose a simple, one-click registration
fifty years after a work was published. Based upon historical data, that
system would move up to 98 percent of commercial work, commercial work that
no longer had a commercial life, into the public domain within fifty
years. What do you think?
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2702995"></a><p>
Da Steve Forbes støttet idéen, begynte enkelte i Washington å følge
med. Mange kontaktet meg med tips til representanter som kan være villig til
å introdusere en Eldred-lov. og jeg hadde noen få som foreslo direkte at de
kan være villige til å ta det første skrittet.
</p><p>
En representant, Zoe Lofgren fra California, gikk så langt som å få
lovforslaget utarbeidet. Utkastet løste noen problemer med internasjonal
lov. Det påla de enklest mulige forutsetninger på innehaverne av
opphavsretter. I mai 2003 så det ut som om loven skulle være introdusert.
16. mai, postet jeg på Eldred Act-bloggen, "vi er nære".  Det oppstod en
generell reaksjon i blogg-samfunnet om at noe godt kunne skje her.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2703028"></a>
</p><p>
But at this stage, the lobbyists began to intervene. Jack Valenti and the
MPAA general counsel came to the congresswoman's office to give the view of
the MPAA. Aided by his lawyer, as Valenti told me, Valenti informed the
congresswoman that the MPAA would oppose the Eldred Act. The reasons are
embarrassingly thin. More importantly, their thinness shows something clear
about what this debate is really about.
</p><p>

The MPAA argued first that Congress had "firmly rejected the central concept
in the proposed bill"&#8212;that copyrights be renewed. That was true, but
irrelevant, as Congress's "firm rejection" had occurred long before the
Internet made subsequent uses much more likely.  Second, they argued that
the proposal would harm poor copyright owners&#8212;apparently those who
could not afford the $1 fee. Third, they argued that Congress had determined
that extending a copyright term would encourage restoration work. Maybe in
the case of the small percentage of work covered by copyright law that is
still commercially valuable, but again this was irrelevant, as the proposal
would not cut off the extended term unless the $1 fee was not paid. Fourth,
the MPAA argued that the bill would impose "enormous" costs, since a
registration system is not free. True enough, but those costs are certainly
less than the costs of clearing the rights for a copyright whose owner is
not known. Fifth, they worried about the risks if the copyright to a story
underlying a film were to pass into the public domain. But what risk is
that? If it is in the public domain, then the film is a valid derivative
use.
</p><p>
Finally, the MPAA argued that existing law enabled copyright owners to do
this if they wanted. But the whole point is that there are thousands of
copyright owners who don't even know they have a copyright to give. Whether
they are free to give away their copyright or not&#8212;a controversial
claim in any case&#8212;unless they know about a copyright, they're not
likely to.
</p><p>
At the beginning of this book, I told two stories about the law reacting to
changes in technology. In the one, common sense prevailed.  In the other,
common sense was delayed. The difference between the two stories was the
power of the opposition&#8212;the power of the side that fought to defend
the status quo. In both cases, a new technology threatened old
interests. But in only one case did those interest's have the power to
protect themselves against this new competitive threat.
</p><p>
Jeg brukte disse to tilfellene som en måte å ramme inn krigen som denne
boken har handlet om.  For her er det også en ny teknologi som tvinger loven
til å reagere.  Og her bør vi også spørre, er loven i tråd med eller i strid
med sunn fornuft.  Hvis sunn fornuft støtter loven, hva forklarer denne
sunne fornuften?
</p><p>



When the issue is piracy, it is right for the law to back the copyright
owners. The commercial piracy that I described is wrong and harmful, and the
law should work to eliminate it. When the issue is p2p sharing, it is easy
to understand why the law backs the owners still: Much of this sharing is
wrong, even if much is harmless. When the issue is copyright terms for the
Mickey Mouses of the world, it is possible still to understand why the law
favors Hollywood: Most people don't recognize the reasons for limiting
copyright terms; it is thus still possible to see good faith within the
resistance.
</p><p>
But when the copyright owners oppose a proposal such as the Eldred Act,
then, finally, there is an example that lays bare the naked selfinterest
driving this war. This act would free an extraordinary range of content that
is otherwise unused. It wouldn't interfere with any copyright owner's desire
to exercise continued control over his content. It would simply liberate
what Kevin Kelly calls the "Dark Content" that fills archives around the
world. So when the warriors oppose a change like this, we should ask one
simple question:
</p><p>
Hva ønsker denne industrien egentlig?
</p><p>
With very little effort, the warriors could protect their content. So the
effort to block something like the Eldred Act is not really about protecting
<span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> content. The effort to block the Eldred Act is an
effort to assure that nothing more passes into the public domain. It is
another step to assure that the public domain will never compete, that there
will be no use of content that is not commercially controlled, and that
there will be no commercial use of content that doesn't require
<span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> permission first.
</p><p>
The opposition to the Eldred Act reveals how extreme the other side is. The
most powerful and sexy and well loved of lobbies really has as its aim not
the protection of "property" but the rejection of a tradition.  Their aim is
not simply to protect what is theirs. <span class="emphasis"><em>Their aim is to assure that
all there is is what is theirs</em></span>.
</p><p>

It is not hard to understand why the warriors take this view. It is not hard
to see why it would benefit them if the competition of the public domain
tied to the Internet could somehow be quashed. Just as RCA feared the
competition of FM, they fear the competition of a public domain connected to
a public that now has the means to create with it and to share its own
creation.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2703181"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2703187"></a><p>
What is hard to understand is why the public takes this view. It is as if
the law made airplanes trespassers. The MPAA stands with the Causbys and
demands that their remote and useless property rights be respected, so that
these remote and forgotten copyright holders might block the progress of
others.
</p><p>
All this seems to follow easily from this untroubled acceptance of the
"property" in intellectual property. Common sense supports it, and so long
as it does, the assaults will rain down upon the technologies of the
Internet. The consequence will be an increasing "permission society." The
past can be cultivated only if you can identify the owner and gain
permission to build upon his work. The future will be controlled by this
dead (and often unfindable) hand of the past.

Until the 1908 Berlin Act of the Berne Convention, national copyright
legislation sometimes made protection depend upon compliance with
formalities such as registration, deposit, and affixation of notice of the
author's claim of copyright. However, starting with the 1908 act, every text
of the Convention has provided that "the enjoyment and the exercise" of
rights guaranteed by the Convention "shall not be subject to any formality."
The prohibition against formalities is presently embodied in Article 5(2) of
the Paris Text of the Berne Convention. Many countries continue to impose
some form of deposit or registration requirement, albeit not as a condition
of copyright. French law, for example, requires the deposit of copies of
works in national repositories, principally the National Museum.  Copies of
books published in the United Kingdom must be deposited in the British
Library. The German Copyright Act provides for a Registrar of Authors where
the author's true name can be filed in the case of anonymous or pseudonymous
works. Paul Goldstein, <em class="citetitle">International Intellectual Property Law,

Det er mer enn trettifem millioner mennesker over hele verden med

millioner har allerede dødd.  Sytten millioner afrikanere er prosentvis
proporsjonalt med syv millioner amerikanere.  Viktigere er det at dette er
17 millioner afrikanere.

Det finnes ingen kur for AIDS, men det finnes medisiner som kan hemme
sykdommens utvikling.  Disse antiretrovirale terapiene er fortsatt
eksperimentelle, men de har hatt en dramatisk effekt allerede.  I USA øker
AIDS-pasienter som regelmessig tar en cocktail av disse medisinene sin
levealder med ti til tjue år. For noen gjøre medisinene sykdommen nesten
usynlig.
</p><p>
Disse medisinene er dyre.  Da de ble først introdusert i USA, kostet de
mellom $10 000 og $15 000 pr. person hvert år.  I dag koster noen av dem $25
000 pr. år.  Med disse prisene har, selvfølgelig, ingen afrikansk stat  råd
til medisinen for det store flertall av sine innbyggere: $15 000 er tredve

Disse prisene er ikke høye fordi ingrediensene til medisinene er dyre.
Disse prisene er høye fordi medisinene er beskyttet av patenter.
Farmasiselskapene som produserer disse livreddende blandingene nyter minst
tjue års monopol på sine oppfinnelser.  De bruker denne monopolmakten til å
hente ut så mye de kan fra markedet.  Ved hjelp av denne makten holder de
prisene høye.
</p><p>
Det er mange som er skeptiske til patenter, spesielt patenter på
medisiner. Det er ikke jeg. Faktisk av alle forskningsområder som kan være
støttet av patenter, er forskning på medisiner, etter min mening, det
klareste tilfelle der patenter er nødvendig. Patenter gir et farmasøytiske
firma en viss forsikring om at hvis det lykkes i å finne opp et nytt
medikament som kan behandle en sykdom, vil det kunne tjene tilbake
investeringen og mer til. Dette ber sosialt et ekstremt verdifullt
insentiv. Jeg er den siste personen som vil argumentere for at loven skal
avskaffe dette, i det minste uten andre endringer.
</p><p>
Men det er én ting å støtte patenter, selv patenter på medisiner. Det er en
annen ting å avgjøre hvordan en best skal håndtere en krise. Og i det
afrikanske ledere begynte å erkjenne ødeleggelsen AIDS brakte, begynte de å
se etter måter å importere HIV-medisiner til kostnader betydelig under
markedspris.
</p><p>
I 1997 forsøkte Sør-Afrika seg på en tilnærming.  Landet vedtok en lov som
tillot import av patenterte medisiner som hadde blitt produsert og solgt i
en annen nasjons marked med godkjenning fra patenteieren.  For eksempel,
hvis medisinen var solgt i India, så kunne den bli importert inn til Afrika
fra India.  Dette kalles "parallellimport" og er generelt tillatt i
internasjonal handelslovgivning, og spesifikt tillatt i den europeiske
union.<sup>[<a name="id2703345" href="#ftn.id2703345" class="footnote">196</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Men USA var imot lovendringen.  Og de nøyde seg ikke med å være imot. Som
International Intellectual Property Association karakteriserte det,
"Myndighetene i USA presset Sør-Afrika . . . til å ikke tillate tvungen
lisensiering eller parallellimport"<sup>[<a name="id2703382" href="#ftn.id2703382" class="footnote">197</a>]</sup>
Gjennom kontoret til USAs handelsrepresentant (USTR), ba myndighetene
Sør-Afrika om å endre loven&#8212;og for å legge press bak den
forespørselen, listet USTR i 1998 opp Sør-Afrika som et land som burde
vurderes for handelsrestriksjoner.  Samme år gikk mer enn førti
farmasiselskaper til retten for å utfordre myndighetenes handlinger. USA
fikk selskap av andre myndigheter fra EU.  Deres påstand, og påstanden til
farmasiselskapene, var at Sør-Afrika brøt sine internasjonale forpliktelser
ved å distriminere mot en bestemt type patenter&#8212;farmasøytiske
patenter.  Kravet fra disse myndighetene, med USA i spissen, var at
Sør-Afrika skulle respektere disse patentene på samme måte som alle andre
patenter, uavhengig av eventuell effekt på behandlingen av AIDS i
Sør-Afrika.<sup>[<a name="id2703411" href="#ftn.id2703411" class="footnote">198</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
Vi bør sette intervensjonen til USA i sammenheng.  Det er ingen tvil om at
patenter ikke er den viktigste årsaken til at Afrikanere ikke har tilgang
til medisiner.  Fattigdom og den totale mangel på effektivt helsevesen betyr
mer. Men uansett om patenter er en viktigste grunnen eller ikke, så har
prisen på medisiner en effekt på etterspørselen, og patenter påvirker
prisen. Så uansett, massiv eller marginal, så var det en effekt av våre
myndigheters intervensjon for å stoppe flyten av medisiner inn til Afrika.
</p><p>
Ved å stoppe flyten av HIV-behandling til Afrika, sikret ikke myndighetene i
USA medisiner til USA borgere. Dette er ikke som hvete (hvis de spise det så
kan ikke vi spise det). Det som USA i effekt intervenerte for å stoppe, var
flyten av kunnskap: Informasjon om hvordan en kan ta kjemikalier som finnes
i Afrika og gjøre disse kjemikaliene om til medisiner som kan redde 15 til
30 millioner liv.
</p><p>
Intervensjonen fra USA ville heller ikke beskytte fortjenesten til
medisinselskapene i USA&#8212; i hvert fall ikke betydelig.  Det var jo ikke
slik at disse landene hadde mulighet til å kjøpe medisinene til de prisene
som medisinselskapene forlangte.  Igjen var afrikanerne for fattige til å ha
råd til disse medisinene til de tilbudte prisene.  Å blokkere for
parallellimport av disse medisinene ville ikke øke salget til de amerikanske
selskapene betydelig.
</p><p>
I stedet var argumentet til fordel for restriksjoner på denne flyten av
informasjon, som var nødvendig for å redde millioner av liv, et argument om
eiendoms ukrenkelighet.<sup>[<a name="id2703505" href="#ftn.id2703505" class="footnote">199</a>]</sup>  Det var på
grunn av at "intellektuell eiendom" ville bli krenket at disse medisinene
ikke skulle flomme inn til Afrika.  Det var prinsippet om viktigheten av
"intellektuell eiendom" som fikk disse myndighetsaktørene til å intervenere
mot Sør-Afrikas mottiltak mot AIDS.
</p><p>
La oss ta et skritt tilbake for et øyeblikk.  En gang om tredve år vil våre
barn se tilbake på oss og spørre, hvordan kunne vi la dette skje?  Hvordan
kunne vi tillate å gjennomføre en politikk hvis direkte kostnad var få 15
til 30 millioner afrikanere til å dø raskere, og hvis eneste virkelige
fordel var å opprettholde "ukrenkeligheten" til en idé?  Hva slags
berettigelse kan noen sinne eksistere for en politikk som resulterer i så
mange døde?  Hva slags galskap er det egentlig som tillater at så mange dør
for slik en abstraksjon?
</p><p>
Noen skylder på farmasiselskapene.  Det gjør ikke jeg.  De er selskaper, og
deres ledere er lovpålagt å tjene penger for selskapene.  De presser på for
en bestemt patentpolitikk, ikke på grunn av idealer, men fordi det er dette
som gjør at de tjener mest penger.  Og dette gjør kun at de tjener mest
penger på grunn av en slags korrupsjon i vårt politiske system&#8212; en
korrupsjon som farmasiselskapene helt klart ikke er ansvarlige for.
</p><p>
Denne korrupsjonen er våre egne politikeres manglende integritet.  For
medisinprodusentene ville elske&#8212;sier de selv, og jeg tror dem &#8212;
å selge sine medisiner så billig som de kan til land i Afrika og andre
steder. Det er utfordringer de må løse å sikre at medisinene ikke kommer
tilbake til USA, men dette er bare teknologiske utfordring. De kan bli
overvunnet.
</p><p>

Et annet problem kan derimot ikke løses. Det er frykten for at en politiker
som skal vise seg og kaller inn lederne hos medisinprodusentene til høring i
senatet eller representantenes hus og spør, "hvordan har det seg at du kan
selge HIV-medisinen i Afrika for bare $1 pr. pille, mens samme pille koster
en amerikansker $1500?" Da det ikke finnes et "kjapt svar" på det
spørsmålet, ville effekten bli regulering av priser i Amerika.
Medisinprodusentene unngård dermed denne spiralen ved å sikre at det første
steget ikke tas.  De forsterker idéen om at eierrettigheter skal være
ukrenkelige.  De legger seg på en rasjonell strategi i en irrasjonell
omgivelse, med den utilsiktede konsekvens at kanskje millioner dør.  Og den
rasjonelle strategien rammes dermed inn ved hjel av dette
ideal&#8212;helligheten til en idé som kalles "immaterielle rettigheter".
</p><p>
Så når du konfronteres av ditt barns sunne fornuft, hva vil du si?  Når den
sunne fornuften hos en generasjon endelig gjør opprør mot hva vi har gjort,
hvordan vil vi rettferdiggjøre det?  Hva er argumentet?
</p><p>
En fornuftig patentpolitikk kunne gå god for og gi sterk støtte til
patentsystemet uten å måtte nå alle overalt på nøyaktig samme måte. På samme
måte som en fornuftig opphavsrettspolitikk kunne gå god for og gi sterk
støtte til et opphavsretts-system uten å måtte regulere spredningen av
kultur perfekt og for alltid.  En fornuftig patentpolitikk kunne gå god for
og gi sterk støtte til et patentsystem uten å måtte blokkere spredning av
medisiner til et land som uansett ikke er rikt nok til å ha råd til
markedsprisen.  En fornuftig politikk kan en dermed si kunne være en
balansert politikk.  For det meste av vår historie har både opphavsrett- og
patentpolitikken i denne forstand vært balansert.
</p><p>

Men vi som kultur har mistet denne følelsen for balanse.  Vi har mistet det
kritiske blikket som hjelper oss til å se forkjellen mellom sannhet og
ekstremisme.  En slags eiendomsfundamentalisme, uten grunnlag i vår
tradisjon, hersker nå i vår kultur&#8212;sært, og med konsekvenser mer
alvorlig for spredningen av idéer og kultur enn nesten enhver annen politisk
enkeltavgjørelse vi som demokrati kan fatte.  En enkel idé blender oss, og
under dekke av mørket skjer mye som de fleste av oss ville avvist hvis vi
hadde fulgt med.  Så ukritisk aksepterer vi idéen om eierskap til idéer at
vi ikke engang legger merke til hvor uhyrlig det er å nekte tilgang til
idéer for et folk som dør uten dem.  Så ukritisk aksepterer vi idéen om
eiendom til kulturen at vi ikke engang stiller spørsmål ved når kontrollen
over denne eiendommen fjerner vår evne, som folk, til å utvikle vår kultur
demokratisk.  Blindhet blir vår sunne fornuft, og utfordringen for enhver
som vil gjenvinne retten til å dyrke vår kultur er å finne en måte å få
denne sunne fornuften til å åpne sine øyne.
</p><p>
Så langt sover sunn fornuft.  Det er intet opprør.  Sunn fornuft ser ennå
ikke hva det er å gjøre opprør mot.  Ekstremismen som nå domunerer denne
debatten resonerer med idéer som virker naturlige, og resonansen er
forsterket av våre moderne RCA-ene.  De fører en frenetisk krig for å
bekjempe "piratvirksomhet" og knuser kreativitetskultur.  De forsvarer idéen
om "kreativt eierskap", mens de endrer ekte skapere til moderne
leilendinger.  De blir fornermet av idéen om at rettigheter skulle være
balanserte, selv om hver av hovedaktørene i denne innholdskrigen selv hadde
fordeler av et mer balansert ideal.  Hykleriet rår.  Men i en by som
Washington blir ikke hykleriet en gang lakt merke til.  Mektige lobbyister,
kompliserte problemer og MTV-oppmerksomhetsspenn gir en "perfekt storm" for
fri kultur.
</p><p>
I august 2003 brøt en kamp ut i USA om en avgjørelse fra World Intellectual
Property Organiation om å avlyse et møte.<sup>[<a name="id2703630" href="#ftn.id2703630" class="footnote">200</a>]</sup> På forespørsel fra en lang rekke med interresenter hadde WIPO
bestemt å avholde et møte for å diskutere "åpne og sammarbeidende prosjekter
for å skape goder for felleskapet".  Disse prosjektene som hadde lyktes i å
produsere goder for fellesskapet uten å basere seg eksklusivt på bruken av
proprietære immaterielle rettigheter.  Eksempler inkluderer internettet og
verdensveven, begge som ble utviklet på grunnlag av protokoller i
allemannseie.  Det hadde med en begynnende trend for å støtte åpne
akademiske tidsskrifter, og inkluderte Public Library of Science-prosjektet
som jeg beskriver i etterordet.  Det inkluderte et prosjekt for a utvikle
enkeltnukleotidforskjeller (SNPs), som er antatt å få stor betydning i
biomedisinsk forskning.  (Dette ideelle prosjektet besto av et konsortium av
Wellcome Trust og farmasøytiske og teknologiske selskaper, inkludert
Amersham Biosciences, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Hoffmann-La Roche, Glaxo-SmithKline, IBM, Motorola, Novartis, Pfizer, og
Searle.)  Det inkluderte Globalt posisjonssystem (GPS) som Ronald Reagen
frigjorde tidlig på 1980-tallet.  Og det inkluderte "åpen kildekode og fri
programvare". <a class="indexterm" name="id2703807"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2703815"></a>
</p><p>
Formålet med møtet var å vurdere denne rekken av prosjekter fra et felles
perspektiv: at ingen av disse prosjektene hadde som grunnlag immateriell
ekstremisme. I stedet, hos alle disse, ble immaterielle rettigheter
balansert med avtaler om å holde tilgang åpen, eller for å legge
begrensninger på hvordan proprietære krav kan bli brukt.
</p><p>
Dermed var, fra perspektivet i denne boken, denne konferansen
ideell.<sup>[<a name="id2703840" href="#ftn.id2703840" class="footnote">201</a>]</sup> Prosjektene innenfor temaet var
både kommersielle og ikkekommersielle verker.  De involverte i hovedsak
vitenskapet, men fra mange perspektiver.  Og WIPO var et ideelt sted for
denne diskusjonen, siden WIPO var den fremstående internasjonale aktør som
drev med immaterielle rettighetsspørsmål.
</p><p>

Faktisk fikk jeg en gang offentlig kjeft for å ikke anerkjenne dette faktum
om WIPO.  I februar 2003 leverte jeg et hovedinnlegg på en forberedende
konferanse for World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).  På en
pressekonferanse før innlegget, ble jeg spurt hva jeg skulle snakke om.  Jeg
svarte at jeg skulle snakke litt om viktigheten av balanse rundt
immaterielle verdier for utviklingen av informasjonssamfunnet.  Ordstyreren
på arrangementet avbrøt meg da brått for å informere meg og journalistene
tilstede at ingen spørsmål rundt immaterielle verdier ville bli diskutert av
WSIS, da slike spørsmål kun skulle diskuteres i WIPO.  I innlegget jeg hadde
forberedt var temaet om immaterielle verdier en forholdvis liten del av det
hele.  Men etter denne forbløffende uttalelsen, gjorde jeg immaterielle
verdier til hovedfokus for mitt innlegg.  Det var ikke mulig å snakke om et
"informasjonssamfunn" uten at en også snakket om andelen av informasjon og
kultur som ikke er vernet av opphavsretten.  Mitt innlegg gjorde ikke min
overivrige moderator veldig glad.  Og hun hadde uten tvil rett i at omfanget
til vern av immaterielle rettigheter normalt hørte inn under WIPO.  Men
etter mitt syn, kunne det ikke bli for mye diskusjon om hvor mye
immaterielle rettigheter som trengs, siden etter mitt syn, hadde selve ideen
om en balanse rundt immaterielle rettigheter hadde gått tapt.
</p><p>
Så uansett om WSIS kan diskutere balanse i intellektuell eiendom eller ikke,
så hadde jeg trodd det var tatt for gitt at WIPO kunne og burde.  Og dermed
møtet om "åpne og samarbeidende prosjekter for å skape fellesgoder" virker å
passe perfekt for WIPOs agenda.
</p><p>
Men det er ett prosjekt i listen som er svært kontroversielt, i hvert fall
blant lobbyister. Dette prosjektet er "åpen kildekode og fri
programvare". Microsoft spesielt er skeptisk til diskusjon om emnet. Fra
deres perspektiv, ville en konferanse for å diskutere åpen kildekode og fri
programvare være som en konferanse for å diskutere Apples operativsystem.
Både åpen kildekode og fri programvare konkurrerer med Microsofts
programvare.  Og internasjonalt har mange myndigheter begynt å utforske krav
om at de skal bruke åpen kildekode eller fri programvare, i stedet for
"proprietær programvare," til sine egne interne behov.
</p><p>
Jeg mener ikke å gå inn i den debatten her.  Det er viktig kun for å gjøre
det klart at skillet ikke er mellom kommersiell og ikke-kommersiell
programvare.  Det er mange viktige selskaper som er fundamentalt avhengig av
fri programvare, der IBM er den mest fremtredende.  IBM har i stadig større
grad skiftet sitt fokus til GNU/Linux-operativsystemet, det mest berømte
biten av "fri programvare"&#8212;og IBM er helt klart en kommernsiell
aktør. Dermed er det å støtte "fri programvare" ikke å motsette seg
kommersielle aktører.  Det er i stedet å støtte en måte å drive
programvareutvikling som er forskjellig fra Microsofts.<sup>[<a name="id2703688" href="#ftn.id2703688" class="footnote">202</a>]</sup> <a class="indexterm" name="id2703993"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2704000"></a>
</p><p>

Mer viktig for våre formål, er at å støtte "åpen kildekode og fri
programvare" ikke er å motsette seg opphasvrett. "Åpen kildekode og fri
programvare" er ikke programvare uten opphavsrettslig vern. Istedet, på
samme måte som programvare fra Microsoft, insisterer opphavsrettsinnehaverne
av fri programvare ganske sterkt at vilkårene i deres programvarelisens blir
respektert av de som tar i bruk fri programvare.  Vilkårene i den lisensen
er uten tvil forskjellig fra vilkårene i en proprietær programvarelisens.
For eksempel krever fri programvare lisensiert med den generelle offentlige
lisensen (GPL), at kildekoden for programvare gjøres tilgjengelig for alle
som endrer og redistribuerer programvaren.  Men dette kravet er kun
effektivt hvis opphavsrett råder over programvare.  Hvis opphavsretten ikke
råder over programvare, så kunne ikke fri programvare pålegge slike krav på
de som tar i bruk programvaren.  Den er dermed like avhengig av
opphavsrettsloven som Microsoft.
</p><p>
Det er dermed forståelig at Microsoft, som utviklere av proprietær
programvare, gikk imot et slikt WIPO-møte, og like fullt forståelig at de
bruker sine lobbyister til å få USAs myndigheter til å gå imot møtet.  Og
ganske riktig, det er akkurat dette som i følge rapporter hadde skjedd.  I
følge Jonathan Krim i <em class="citetitle">Washington Post</em>, lyktes
Microsofts lobbyister i å få USAs myndigheter til å legge ned veto mot et
slikt møte.<sup>[<a name="id2704063" href="#ftn.id2704063" class="footnote">203</a>]</sup> Og uten støtte fra USA ble
møtet avlyst.
</p><p>
Jeg klandrer ikke Microsoft for å gjøre det de kan for å fremme sine egne
interesser i samsvar med loven. Og lobbyvirksomhet mot myndighetene er
åpenbart i samsvar med loven. Det er ikke noe overraskende her med deres
lobbyvirksomhet, og ikke veldig overraskende at den mektigste
programvareprodusenten i USA har lyktes med sin lobbyvirksomhet.
</p><p>
Det som var overraskende var USAs regjerings begrunnelse for å være imot
møtet.  Igjen, siterert av krim, forklarte Lois Boland, direktør for
internasjonale forbindelser ved USAs patent og varemerkekontor, at
"programvare med åpen kildekode går imot til formålet til WIPO, som er å
fremme immatterielle rettigheter.".  Hun skal i følge sitatet ha sagt, "Å
holde et møte som har som formål å fraskrive seg eller frafalle slike
rettigheter synes for oss å være i strid med formålene til WIPO."
</p><p>
Disse utsagnene er forbløffende på flere nivåer.
</p><p>
For det første er de ganske enkelt enkelt ikke riktige.  Som jeg beskrev, er
det meste av åpen kildekode og fri programvare fundamentalt avhengig av den
immaterielle retten kalt "opphavsrett".  Uten den vil begresningene definert
av disse lisensene ikke fungere. Dermed er det å si at de "går imot"
formålet om å fremme immaterielle rettigheter å avsløre en ekstraordinær
mangel på forståelse&#8212;den type feil som er tilgivelig hos en førsteårs
jusstudent, men pinlig fra en høyt plassert statstjenestemann som håndterer
utfordringer rundt immaterielle rettigheter.
</p><p>
For det andre, hvem har noen gang hevdet at WIPOs eksklusive mål var å
"fremme" immaterielle rettigheter maksimalt?  Som jeg fikk kjeft om på den
forberedende konferansen til WSIS, skal WIPO vurdere ikke bare hvordan best
beskytte immaterielle rettigheter, men også hva som er den beste balansen
rundt immaterielle rettigheter.  Som enhver økonom og advokat vet, er det
vanskelige spørsmålet i immaterielle rettighetsjuss å finne den balansen.
Men at det skulle være en grense, trodde jeg, var ubestridt.  Man ønsker å
spørre Ms. boland om generelle medisiner (medisiner basert på medisiner med
patenter som er utløpt) i strid med WIPOs oppdrag?  Svekker allemannseie
immaterielle rettigheter?  Ville det vært bedre om internettets protokoller
hadde vært patentert?
</p><p>
For det tredje, selv om en tror at formålet med WIPO var å maksimere
immaterielle rettigheter, så innehas immaterielle rettigheter, i vår
tradisjon, av individer og selskaper.  De får bestemme hva som skal gjøres
med disse rettighetene, igjen fordi det er <span class="emphasis"><em>de</em></span> som eier
rettigetene. Hvis de ønsker å "frafalle" eller "frasi" seg sine rettigheter,
så er det helt etter boka i vår tradisjon.  Når Bill Gates gir bort mer enn
$20 milliarder til gode formål, så er ikke det uforenelig med målene til
eiendomssystemet.  Det er heller tvert i mot, akkurat hva eiendomssysstemet
er ment å oppnå, at individer har retten til å bestemme hva de vil gjøre med
<span class="emphasis"><em>sin</em></span> eiendom.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2704201"></a>
</p><p>

Når Ms. Boland sier at det er noe galt med et møte "som har som sitt formål
å fraskrive eller frafalle slike rettigheter", så sier hun at WIPO har en
interesse i å påvirke valgene til enkeltpersoner som eier immaterielle
rettigheter.  At på en eller annen WIPOs oppdrag bør være å stoppe individer
fra å "frakrive" eller "frafalle" seg sine immaterielle rettigheter.  At
interessen til WIPO ikke bare er  maksimale immaterielle rettigheter, men
også at de skal utøves på den mest ekstreme og restriktive mulig måten.
</p><p>
Det er en historie om akkurat et slikt eierskapssystem som er velkjent i den
anglo-amerikansk tradisjon.  Det kalles "føydalisme". Under føydalismen var
eiendommer ikke bare kontrollert av et relativt lite antall individer og
aktører.  Men det føydale systemet hadde en sterk interesse i å sikre at
landeier i systemet ikke svekke føydalismen ved å frigjøre folkene og
eiendomene som de kontrollerte til det frie markedet.  Føydalismen var
avhengig av maksimal kontroll og konsentrasjon.  Det sloss mot enhver frihet
som kunne forstyrre denne kontrollen.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2704240"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2704247"></a><p>
Som Peter Drahos og John Braithwaite beskriver, dette er nøyaktig det valget
vi nå gjør om immaterielle rettigheter.<sup>[<a name="id2704259" href="#ftn.id2704259" class="footnote">204</a>]</sup>
Vi kommer til å få et informasjonssamfunn.  Så mye er sikkert.  Vårt eneste
valg nå er hvorvidt dette informasjonssamfunnet skal være
<span class="emphasis"><em>fritt</em></span> eller <span class="emphasis"><em>føydalt</em></span>.  Trenden er
mot det føydale.
</p><p>
Da denne bataljen brøt ut, blogget jeg om dette.  En heftig debatt brøt ut i
kommentarfeltet.  Ms. Boland hadde en rekke støttespillere som forsøkte å
vise hvorfor hennes kommentarer ga mening.  Men det var spesielt en
kommentar som gjorde meg trist.  En anonym kommentator skrev,
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

George, du misforstår Lessig: Han snakker bare om verden slik den burde være
("målet til WIPO, og målet til enhver regjering, bør være å fremme den
riktige balansen for immaterielle rettigheter, ikke bare å fremme
immaterielle rettigheter"), ikke som den er.  Hvis vi snakket om verden slik
den er, så har naturligvis Boland ikke sagt noe galt.  Men i verden slik
Lessig vil at den skal være, er det åpenbart at hun har sagt noe galt.  En
må alltid være oppmerksom på forskjellen mellom Lessigs og vår verden.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Jeg gikk glipp av ironien først gangen jeg leste den. Jeg lese den raskt og
trodde forfatteren støttet idéen om at det våre myndigheter burde gjøre var
å søke balanse. (Min kritikk av Ms Boland, selvfølgelig, var ikke om
hvorvidt hun søkte balanse eller ikke; min kritikk var at hennes kommentarer
avslørte en feil kun en førsteårs jussstudent burde kunne gjøre. Jeg har
noen illusjon om ekstremismen hos våre myndigheter, uansett om de er
republikanere eller demokrater. Min eneste tilsynelatende illusjon er
hvorvidt våre myndigheter bør snakke sant eller ikke.)
</p><p>
Det var dermot åpenbart at den som postet meldingen ikke støttet idéen.  I
stedet latterliggjorde forfatteren selve idéen om at i den virkelig verden
skulle "målet" til myndighetene være "å fremme den riktige balanse" for
immaterielle rettigheter.  Det var åpenbart tåpelig for ham.  Og det
avslørte åpenbart, trodde han, min egen tåpelige utopisme.  "Typisk for en
akademiker", kunne forfatteren like gjerne ha fortsatt.
</p><p>
Jeg forstår kritikken av akademisk utopisme.  Jeg mener også at utopisme er
tåpelig, og jeg vil være blant de første til å gjøre narr av de aburde
urealisistiske idealer til akademikere gjennom historien (og ikke bare i
vårt eget lands historie).
</p><p>
Men når det har blitt dumt å anta at rollen til våre myndigheter bør være å
"oppnå balanse", da kan du regne meg blant de dumme, for det betyr at dette
faktisk har blitt ganske seriøst.  Hvis det bør være åpenbart for alle at
myndighetene ikke søker å oppnå balanse, at myndighetene ganske enkelt et
verktøy for de mektigste lobbyistene, at ideen om å forvente bedre av
myndighetene er absurd, at ideen om å kreve at myndighetene snakker sant og
ikke lyver bare er naiv, hva har da vi, det mektigste demokratiet i verden,
blitt?
</p><p>

Det kan være galskap å forvente at en mektig myndigshetsperson skal si
sannheten. Det kan være galskap å tro at myndighetenes politikk skal gjøre
mer enn å tjene de mektigste interesser. Det kan være galskap å argumentere
for å bevare en tradisjon som har vært en del av vår tradisjon for
mesteparten av vår historie&#8212;fri kultur.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2704384"></a><p>
Hvis dette er galskap, så la det være mer gærninger.  Snart. Det finnes
øyeblikk av håp i denne kampen. Og øyeblikk som overrasker. Da FCC vurderte
mindre strenge eierskapregler, som ville ytterligere konsentrere
mediaeierskap, dannet det seg en en ekstraordinær koalisjon på tvers av
partiene for å bekjempe endringen. For kanskje første gang i historien
organiserte interesser så forskjellige som NRA, ACLU, moveon.org, William
Safire, Ted Turner og Codepink Women for Piece seg for å protestere på denne
endringen i FCC-reglene.  Så mange som 700 000 brev ble sendt til FCC med
krav om flere høringer og et annet resultat.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2704405"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="id2704412"></a>
</p><p>
Disse protestene stoppet ikke FCC, men like etter stemte en bred koalisjon i
senatet for å reversere avgjørelsen i FCC. De fientlige høringene som ledet
til avstemmingen avslørte hvor mektig denne bevegelsen hadde blitt.  Det var
ingen betydnigsfull støtte for FCCs avgjørelse, mens det var bred og
vedvarende støtte for å bekjempe ytterligere konsentrasjon i media.
</p><p>
Men selv denne bevegelsen går glipp av en viktig brikke i puslespillet.  Å
være stor er ikke ille i seg selv. Frihet er ikke truet bare på grunn av at
noen blir veldig rik, eller på grunn av at det bare er en håndfull store
aktører.  Den dårlige kvaliteten til Big Macs eller Quartar Punders betyr
ikke at du ikke kan få en god hamburger andre steder.

Faren med mediekonsentrasjon kommer ikke fra selve konsentrasjonen, men
kommer fra føydalismen som denne konsentrasjonen fører til når den kobles
til endringer i opphavsretten. Det er ikke kun at det er noen mektige
selskaper som styrer en stadig voksende andel av mediene. Det er at denne
konsentrasjonen kan påkalle en like oppsvulmet rekke
rettigheter&#8212;eiendomsrettigheter i en historisk ekstrem form&#8212;som
gjør størrelsen ille.
</p><p>
Det er derfor betydningsfullt at så mange vil kjempe for å kreve konkurranse
og økt mangfold. Likevel, hvis kampanjen blir forstått til å kun gjelde
størrelse, så er ikke det veldig overraskende. Vi amerikanere har en lang
historie med å slåss mot "stort", klokt eller ikke. At vi kan være motivert
til å slåss mot "store" igjen ikke noe nytt.
</p><p>
Det ville vært noe nytt, og noe veldig viktig, hvis like mange kan være med
på en kampanje for å bekjempe økende ekstremisme bygget inn i idéen om
"intellektuell eiendom".  Ikke fordi balanse er fremmed for vår
tradisjon. Jeg agumenterer for at balanse er vår tradisjon.  Men fordi evnen
til å tenke kritisk på omfanget av alt som kalles "eiendom" ikke er lenger
er godt trent i denne tradisjonen.
</p><p>
Hvis vi var Akilles, så ville dette være vår hæl. Dette ville være stedet
for våre tragedie.

potensialet for digital teknologi blir knust.  Det vil kreve omtanke, og
viktigere, det vil kreve at noen omforme RCAene av i dag til Causbyere.

Sunn fornuft må gjøre opprør. Den må handle for å frigjøre kulturen. Og
snart, hvis dette potensialet skal noen gang bli realisert.

Microsofts posisjon om åpen kildekode og fri programvare er mer
sofistikert.  De har flere ganger forklart at de har ikke noe problem med
programvare som er "åpen kildekode" eller programvare som er allemannseie.
Microsofts prinsipielle motstand er mot "fri programvare" lisensiert med en
"copyleft"-lisens, som betyr at lisensen krever at de som lisensierer skal
adoptere same vilkår for ethvert avledet verk.  Se Bradford L. Smith, "The

I hvert fall noen av de som har lest helt hit vil være enig med meg om at
noe må gjøres for å endre retningen vi holder.  Balansen i denne boken
kartlegger hva som kan gjøres.
</p><p>
I divide this map into two parts: that which anyone can do now, and that
which requires the help of lawmakers. If there is one lesson that we can
draw from the history of remaking common sense, it is that it requires
remaking how many people think about the very same issue.
</p><p>
That means this movement must begin in the streets. It must recruit a
significant number of parents, teachers, librarians, creators, authors,
musicians, filmmakers, scientists&#8212;all to tell this story in their own
words, and to tell their neighbors why this battle is so important.
</p><p>
Once this movement has its effect in the streets, it has some hope of having
an effect in Washington. We are still a democracy. What people think
matters. Not as much as it should, at least when an RCA stands opposed, but
still, it matters. And thus, in the second part below, I sketch changes that
Congress could make to better secure a free culture.
</p><div class="section" title="Oss, nå"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="usnow"></a>Oss, nå</h2></div></div></div><p>
Common sense is with the copyright warriors because the debate so far has
been framed at the extremes&#8212;as a grand either/or: either property or
anarchy, either total control or artists won't be paid. If that really is
the choice, then the warriors should win.
</p><p>
The mistake here is the error of the excluded middle. There are extremes in
this debate, but the extremes are not all that there is. There are those who
believe in maximal copyright&#8212;"All Rights Reserved"&#8212; and those
who reject copyright&#8212;"No Rights Reserved." The "All Rights Reserved"
sorts believe that you should ask permission before you "use" a copyrighted
work in any way. The "No Rights Reserved" sorts believe you should be able
to do with content as you wish, regardless of whether you have permission or
not.
</p><p>

When the Internet was first born, its initial architecture effectively
tilted in the "no rights reserved" direction. Content could be copied
perfectly and cheaply; rights could not easily be controlled. Thus,
regardless of anyone's desire, the effective regime of copyright under the
original design of the Internet was "no rights reserved." Content was
"taken" regardless of the rights. Any rights were effectively unprotected.
</p><p>
This initial character produced a reaction (opposite, but not quite equal)
by copyright owners. That reaction has been the topic of this book. Through
legislation, litigation, and changes to the network's design, copyright
holders have been able to change the essential character of the environment
of the original Internet. If the original architecture made the effective
default "no rights reserved," the future architecture will make the
effective default "all rights reserved." The architecture and law that
surround the Internet's design will increasingly produce an environment
where all use of content requires permission.  The "cut and paste" world
that defines the Internet today will become a "get permission to cut and
paste" world that is a creator's nightmare.
</p><p>
What's needed is a way to say something in the middle&#8212;neither "all
rights reserved" nor "no rights reserved" but "some rights reserved"&#8212;
and thus a way to respect copyrights but enable creators to free content as
they see fit. In other words, we need a way to restore a set of freedoms
that we could just take for granted before.
</p><div class="section" title="Gjenoppbygging av friheter som tidligere var antatt: Eksempler"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="examples"></a>Gjenoppbygging av friheter som tidligere var antatt: Eksempler</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you step back from the battle I've been describing here, you will
recognize this problem from other contexts. Think about privacy. Before the
Internet, most of us didn't have to worry much about data about our lives
that we broadcast to the world. If you walked into a bookstore and browsed
through some of the works of Karl Marx, you didn't need to worry about
explaining your browsing habits to your neighbors or boss. The "privacy" of
your browsing habits was assured.
</p><p>
Hva gjorde at det var sikret?
</p><p>
Well, if we think in terms of the modalities I described in chapter <a class="xref" href="#property-i" title='Kapittel 11. Kapittel ti: "Eiendom"'>11</a>, your privacy was
assured because of an inefficient architecture for gathering data and hence
a market constraint (cost) on anyone who wanted to gather that data. If you
were a suspected spy for North Korea, working for the CIA, no doubt your
privacy would not be assured.  But that's because the CIA would (we hope)
find it valuable enough to spend the thousands required to track you. But
for most of us (again, we can hope), spying doesn't pay. The highly
inefficient architecture of real space means we all enjoy a fairly robust
amount of privacy. That privacy is guaranteed to us by friction. Not by law
(there is no law protecting "privacy" in public places), and in many places,
not by norms (snooping and gossip are just fun), but instead, by the costs
that friction imposes on anyone who would want to spy.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2704872"></a><p>
Enter the Internet, where the cost of tracking browsing in particular has
become quite tiny. If you're a customer at Amazon, then as you browse the
pages, Amazon collects the data about what you've looked at. You know this
because at the side of the page, there's a list of "recently viewed"
pages. Now, because of the architecture of the Net and the function of
cookies on the Net, it is easier to collect the data than not. The friction
has disappeared, and hence any "privacy" protected by the friction
disappears, too.
</p><p>
Amazon, of course, is not the problem. But we might begin to worry about
libraries. If you're one of those crazy lefties who thinks that people
should have the "right" to browse in a library without the government
knowing which books you look at (I'm one of those lefties, too), then this
change in the technology of monitoring might concern you. If it becomes
simple to gather and sort who does what in electronic spaces, then the
friction-induced privacy of yesterday disappears.
</p><p>

It is this reality that explains the push of many to define "privacy" on the
Internet. It is the recognition that technology can remove what friction
before gave us that leads many to push for laws to do what friction
did.<sup>[<a name="id2704910" href="#ftn.id2704910" class="footnote">210</a>]</sup> And whether you're in favor of
those laws or not, it is the pattern that is important here. We must take
affirmative steps to secure a kind of freedom that was passively provided
before. A change in technology now forces those who believe in privacy to
affirmatively act where, before, privacy was given by default.
</p><p>
A similar story could be told about the birth of the free software
movement. When computers with software were first made available
commercially, the software&#8212;both the source code and the
binaries&#8212; was free. You couldn't run a program written for a Data
General machine on an IBM machine, so Data General and IBM didn't care much
about controlling their software.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2704950"></a><p>
Dette var verden Richard Stallman ble født inn i, og mens han var forsker
ved MIT, lærte han til å elske samfunnet som utviklet seg når en var fri til
å utforske og fikle med programvaren som kjørte på datamaskiner. Av den
smarte sorten selv, og en talentfull programmerer, begynte Stallman å basere
seg frihet til å legge til eller endre på andre personers arbeid.
</p><p>
In an academic setting, at least, that's not a terribly radical idea. In a
math department, anyone would be free to tinker with a proof that someone
offered. If you thought you had a better way to prove a theorem, you could
take what someone else did and change it. In a classics department, if you
believed a colleague's translation of a recently discovered text was flawed,
you were free to improve it. Thus, to Stallman, it seemed obvious that you
should be free to tinker with and improve the code that ran a machine. This,
too, was knowledge. Why shouldn't it be open for criticism like anything
else?
</p><p>
No one answered that question. Instead, the architecture of revenue for
computing changed. As it became possible to import programs from one system
to another, it became economically attractive (at least in the view of some)
to hide the code of your program. So, too, as companies started selling
peripherals for mainframe systems. If I could just take your printer driver
and copy it, then that would make it easier for me to sell a printer to the
market than it was for you.
</p><p>

Thus, the practice of proprietary code began to spread, and by the early
1980s, Stallman found himself surrounded by proprietary code.  The world of
free software had been erased by a change in the economics of computing. And
as he believed, if he did nothing about it, then the freedom to change and
share software would be fundamentally weakened.
</p><p>
Derfor, i 1984, startet Stallmann på et prosjekt for å bygge et fritt
operativsystem, slik i hvert fall en flik av fri programvare skulle
overleve.  Dette var starten på GNU-prosjektet, som "Linux"-kjernen til
Linus Torvalds senere ble lagt til i for å produsere
GNU/Linux-operativsystemet. <a class="indexterm" name="id2705028"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2705034"></a>
</p><p>
Stallman's technique was to use copyright law to build a world of software
that must be kept free. Software licensed under the Free Software
Foundation's GPL cannot be modified and distributed unless the source code
for that software is made available as well. Thus, anyone building upon
GPL'd software would have to make their buildings free as well. This would
assure, Stallman believed, that an ecology of code would develop that
remained free for others to build upon. His fundamental goal was freedom;
innovative creative code was a byproduct.
</p><p>
Stallman was thus doing for software what privacy advocates now do for
privacy. He was seeking a way to rebuild a kind of freedom that was taken
for granted before. Through the affirmative use of licenses that bind
copyrighted code, Stallman was affirmatively reclaiming a space where free
software would survive. He was actively protecting what before had been
passively guaranteed.
</p><p>
Finally, consider a very recent example that more directly resonates with
the story of this book. This is the shift in the way academic and scientific
journals are produced.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="idxacademocjournals"></a><p>

As digital technologies develop, it is becoming obvious to many that
printing thousands of copies of journals every month and sending them to
libraries is perhaps not the most efficient way to distribute
knowledge. Instead, journals are increasingly becoming electronic, and
libraries and their users are given access to these electronic journals
through password-protected sites. Something similar to this has been
happening in law for almost thirty years: Lexis and Westlaw have had
electronic versions of case reports available to subscribers to their
service.  Although a Supreme Court opinion is not copyrighted, and anyone is
free to go to a library and read it, Lexis and Westlaw are also free to
charge users for the privilege of gaining access to that Supreme Court
opinion through their respective services.
</p><p>
There's nothing wrong in general with this, and indeed, the ability to
charge for access to even public domain materials is a good incentive for
people to develop new and innovative ways to spread knowledge.  The law has
agreed, which is why Lexis and Westlaw have been allowed to flourish. And if
there's nothing wrong with selling the public domain, then there could be
nothing wrong, in principle, with selling access to material that is not in
the public domain.
</p><p>
But what if the only way to get access to social and scientific data was
through proprietary services? What if no one had the ability to browse this
data except by paying for a subscription?
</p><p>
As many are beginning to notice, this is increasingly the reality with
scientific journals. When these journals were distributed in paper form,
libraries could make the journals available to anyone who had access to the
library. Thus, patients with cancer could become cancer experts because the
library gave them access. Or patients trying to understand the risks of a
certain treatment could research those risks by reading all available
articles about that treatment. This freedom was therefore a function of the
institution of libraries (norms) and the technology of paper journals
(architecture)&#8212;namely, that it was very hard to control access to a
paper journal.
</p><p>
As journals become electronic, however, the publishers are demanding that
libraries not give the general public access to the journals. This means
that the freedoms provided by print journals in public libraries begin to
disappear. Thus, as with privacy and with software, a changing technology
and market shrink a freedom taken for granted before.
</p><p>
This shrinking freedom has led many to take affirmative steps to restore the
freedom that has been lost. The Public Library of Science (PLoS), for
example, is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to making scientific research
available to anyone with a Web connection. Authors of scientific work submit
that work to the Public Library of Science.  That work is then subject to
peer review. If accepted, the work is then deposited in a public, electronic
archive and made permanently available for free. PLoS also sells a print
version of its work, but the copyright for the print journal does not
inhibit the right of anyone to redistribute the work for free.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2705157"></a>
</p><p>
This is one of many such efforts to restore a freedom taken for granted
before, but now threatened by changing technology and markets.  There's no
doubt that this alternative competes with the traditional publishers and
their efforts to make money from the exclusive distribution of content. But
competition in our tradition is presumptively a good&#8212;especially when
it helps spread knowledge and science.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2705167"></a></div><div class="section" title="Gjenoppbygging av fri kultur: En idé"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="oneidea"></a>Gjenoppbygging av fri kultur: En idé</h3></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="idxcc"></a><p>
The same strategy could be applied to culture, as a response to the
increasing control effected through law and technology.
</p><p>
Enter the Creative Commons. The Creative Commons is a nonprofit corporation
established in Massachusetts, but with its home at Stanford University. Its
aim is to build a layer of <span class="emphasis"><em>reasonable</em></span> copyright on top
of the extremes that now reign. It does this by making it easy for people to
build upon other people's work, by making it simple for creators to express
the freedom for others to take and build upon their work. Simple tags, tied
to human-readable descriptions, tied to bulletproof licenses, make this
possible.
</p><p>

<span class="emphasis"><em>Simple</em></span>&#8212;which means without a middleman, or
without a lawyer.  By developing a free set of licenses that people can
attach to their content, Creative Commons aims to mark a range of content
that can easily, and reliably, be built upon. These tags are then linked to
machine-readable versions of the license that enable computers automatically
to identify content that can easily be shared. These three expressions
together&#8212;a legal license, a human-readable description, and
machine-readable tags&#8212;constitute a Creative Commons license. A
Creative Commons license constitutes a grant of freedom to anyone who
accesses the license, and more importantly, an expression of the ideal that
the person associated with the license believes in something different than
the "All" or "No" extremes. Content is marked with the CC mark, which does
not mean that copyright is waived, but that certain freedoms are given.
</p><p>
These freedoms are beyond the freedoms promised by fair use. Their precise
contours depend upon the choices the creator makes. The creator can choose a
license that permits any use, so long as attribution is given. She can
choose a license that permits only noncommercial use.  She can choose a
license that permits any use so long as the same freedoms are given to other
uses ("share and share alike"). Or any use so long as no derivative use is
made. Or any use at all within developing nations. Or any sampling use, so
long as full copies are not made. Or lastly, any educational use.
</p><p>
These choices thus establish a range of freedoms beyond the default of
copyright law. They also enable freedoms that go beyond traditional fair
use. And most importantly, they express these freedoms in a way that
subsequent users can use and rely upon without the need to hire a
lawyer. Creative Commons thus aims to build a layer of content, governed by
a layer of reasonable copyright law, that others can build upon. Voluntary
choice of individuals and creators will make this content available. And
that content will in turn enable us to rebuild a public domain.
</p><p>
This is just one project among many within the Creative Commons.  And of
course, Creative Commons is not the only organization pursuing such
freedoms. But the point that distinguishes the Creative Commons from many is
that we are not interested only in talking about a public domain or in
getting legislators to help build a public domain. Our aim is to build a
movement of consumers and producers of content ("content conducers," as
attorney Mia Garlick calls them)  who help build the public domain and, by
their work, demonstrate the importance of the public domain to other
creativity.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2705292"></a>
</p><p>
The aim is not to fight the "All Rights Reserved" sorts. The aim is to
complement them. The problems that the law creates for us as a culture are
produced by insane and unintended consequences of laws written centuries
ago, applied to a technology that only Jefferson could have imagined. The
rules may well have made sense against a background of technologies from
centuries ago, but they do not make sense against the background of digital
technologies. New rules&#8212;with different freedoms, expressed in ways so
that humans without lawyers can use them&#8212;are needed. Creative Commons
gives people a way effectively to begin to build those rules.
</p><p>
Why would creators participate in giving up total control? Some participate
to better spread their content. Cory Doctorow, for example, is a science
fiction author. His first novel, <em class="citetitle">Down and Out in the Magic
Kingdom</em>, was released on-line and for free, under a Creative
Commons license, on the same day that it went on sale in bookstores.
</p><p>
Why would a publisher ever agree to this? I suspect his publisher reasoned
like this: There are two groups of people out there: (1)  those who will buy
Cory's book whether or not it's on the Internet, and (2) those who may never
hear of Cory's book, if it isn't made available for free on the
Internet. Some part of (1) will download Cory's book instead of buying
it. Call them bad-(1)s. Some part of (2)  will download Cory's book, like
it, and then decide to buy it. Call them (2)-goods.  If there are more
(2)-goods than bad-(1)s, the strategy of releasing Cory's book free on-line
will probably <span class="emphasis"><em>increase</em></span> sales of Cory's book.
</p><p>
Indeed, the experience of his publisher clearly supports that conclusion.
The book's first printing was exhausted months before the publisher had
expected. This first novel of a science fiction author was a total success.
</p><p>

The idea that free content might increase the value of nonfree content was
confirmed by the experience of another author. Peter Wayner, who wrote a
book about the free software movement titled <em class="citetitle">Free for
All</em>, made an electronic version of his book free on-line under a
Creative Commons license after the book went out of print. He then monitored
used book store prices for the book. As predicted, as the number of
downloads increased, the used book price for his book increased, as well.
</p><p>
These are examples of using the Commons to better spread proprietary
content. I believe that is a wonderful and common use of the Commons. There
are others who use Creative Commons licenses for other reasons. Many who use
the "sampling license" do so because anything else would be
hypocritical. The sampling license says that others are free, for commercial
or noncommercial purposes, to sample content from the licensed work; they
are just not free to make full copies of the licensed work available to
others. This is consistent with their own art&#8212;they, too, sample from
others. Because the <span class="emphasis"><em>legal</em></span> costs of sampling are so high
(Walter Leaphart, manager of the rap group Public Enemy, which was born
sampling the music of others, has stated that he does not "allow" Public
Enemy to sample anymore, because the legal costs are so high<sup>[<a name="id2705376" href="#ftn.id2705376" class="footnote">211</a>]</sup>), these artists release into the creative
environment content that others can build upon, so that their form of
creativity might grow.
</p><p>
Finally, there are many who mark their content with a Creative Commons
license just because they want to express to others the importance of
balance in this debate. If you just go along with the system as it is, you
are effectively saying you believe in the "All Rights Reserved" model. Good
for you, but many do not. Many believe that however appropriate that rule is
for Hollywood and freaks, it is not an appropriate description of how most
creators view the rights associated with their content. The Creative Commons
license expresses this notion of "Some Rights Reserved," and gives many the
chance to say it to others.
</p><p>

In the first six months of the Creative Commons experiment, over 1 million
objects were licensed with these free-culture licenses. The next step is
partnerships with middleware content providers to help them build into their
technologies simple ways for users to mark their content with Creative
Commons freedoms. Then the next step is to watch and celebrate creators who
build content based upon content set free.
</p><p>
These are first steps to rebuilding a public domain. They are not mere
arguments; they are action. Building a public domain is the first step to
showing people how important that domain is to creativity and
innovation. Creative Commons relies upon voluntary steps to achieve this
rebuilding. They will lead to a world in which more than voluntary steps are
possible.
</p><p>
Creative Commons is just one example of voluntary efforts by individuals and
creators to change the mix of rights that now govern the creative field. The
project does not compete with copyright; it complements it. Its aim is not
to defeat the rights of authors, but to make it easier for authors and
creators to exercise their rights more flexibly and cheaply. That
difference, we believe, will enable creativity to spread more easily.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2705466"></a></div></div><div class="section" title="Dem, snart"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="themsoon"></a>Dem, snart</h2></div></div></div><p>
We will not reclaim a free culture by individual action alone. It will also
take important reforms of laws. We have a long way to go before the
politicians will listen to these ideas and implement these reforms.  But
that also means that we have time to build awareness around the changes that
we need.
</p><p>
In this chapter, I outline five kinds of changes: four that are general, and
one that's specific to the most heated battle of the day, music. Each is a
step, not an end. But any of these steps would carry us a long way to our
end.
</p><div class="section" title="1. Flere formaliteter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="formalities"></a>1. Flere formaliteter</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you buy a house, you have to record the sale in a deed. If you buy land
upon which to build a house, you have to record the purchase in a deed.  If
you buy a car, you get a bill of sale and register the car. If you buy an
airplane ticket, it has your name on it.
</p><p>


These are all formalities associated with property. They are requirements
that we all must bear if we want our property to be protected.
</p><p>
In contrast, under current copyright law, you automatically get a copyright,
regardless of whether you comply with any formality. You don't have to
register. You don't even have to mark your content. The default is control,
and "formalities" are banished.
</p><p>
Why?
</p><p>
As I suggested in chapter <a class="xref" href="#property-i" title='Kapittel 11. Kapittel ti: "Eiendom"'>11</a>, the motivation to abolish formalities was a good
one. In the world before digital technologies, formalities imposed a burden
on copyright holders without much benefit. Thus, it was progress when the
law relaxed the formal requirements that a copyright owner must bear to
protect and secure his work. Those formalities were getting in the way.
</p><p>
But the Internet changes all this. Formalities today need not be a
burden. Rather, the world without formalities is the world that burdens
creativity. Today, there is no simple way to know who owns what, or with
whom one must deal in order to use or build upon the creative work of
others. There are no records, there is no system to trace&#8212; there is no
simple way to know how to get permission. Yet given the massive increase in
the scope of copyright's rule, getting permission is a necessary step for
any work that builds upon our past. And thus, the <span class="emphasis"><em>lack</em></span>
of formalities forces many into silence where they otherwise could speak.
</p><p>
The law should therefore change this requirement<sup>[<a name="id2705571" href="#ftn.id2705571" class="footnote">212</a>]</sup>&#8212;but it should not change it by going back to the old, broken
system. We should require formalities, but we should establish a system that
will create the incentives to minimize the burden of these formalities.
</p><p>
The important formalities are three: marking copyrighted work, registering
copyrights, and renewing the claim to copyright. Traditionally, the first of
these three was something the copyright owner did; the second two were
something the government did. But a revised system of formalities would
banish the government from the process, except for the sole purpose of
approving standards developed by others.
</p><div class="section" title="Registrering og fornying"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="registration"></a>Registrering og fornying</h4></div></div></div><p>
Under the old system, a copyright owner had to file a registration with the
Copyright Office to register or renew a copyright. When filing that
registration, the copyright owner paid a fee. As with most government
agencies, the Copyright Office had little incentive to minimize the burden
of registration; it also had little incentive to minimize the fee.  And as
the Copyright Office is not a main target of government policymaking, the
office has historically been terribly underfunded. Thus, when people who
know something about the process hear this idea about formalities, their
first reaction is panic&#8212;nothing could be worse than forcing people to
deal with the mess that is the Copyright Office.
</p><p>
Yet it is always astonishing to me that we, who come from a tradition of
extraordinary innovation in governmental design, can no longer think
innovatively about how governmental functions can be designed.  Just because
there is a public purpose to a government role, it doesn't follow that the
government must actually administer the role. Instead, we should be creating
incentives for private parties to serve the public, subject to standards
that the government sets.
</p><p>
In the context of registration, one obvious model is the Internet.  There
are at least 32 million Web sites registered around the world.  Domain name
owners for these Web sites have to pay a fee to keep their registration
alive. In the main top-level domains (.com, .org, .net), there is a central
registry. The actual registrations are, however, performed by many competing
registrars. That competition drives the cost of registering down, and more
importantly, it drives the ease with which registration occurs up.
</p><p>

We should adopt a similar model for the registration and renewal of
copyrights. The Copyright Office may well serve as the central registry, but
it should not be in the registrar business. Instead, it should establish a
database, and a set of standards for registrars. It should approve
registrars that meet its standards. Those registrars would then compete with
one another to deliver the cheapest and simplest systems for registering and
renewing copyrights. That competition would substantially lower the burden
of this formality&#8212;while producing a database of registrations that
would facilitate the licensing of content.
</p></div><div class="section" title="Merking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="marking"></a>Merking</h4></div></div></div><p>
It used to be that the failure to include a copyright notice on a creative
work meant that the copyright was forfeited. That was a harsh punishment for
failing to comply with a regulatory rule&#8212;akin to imposing the death
penalty for a parking ticket in the world of creative rights.  Here again,
there is no reason that a marking requirement needs to be enforced in this
way. And more importantly, there is no reason a marking requirement needs to
be enforced uniformly across all media.
</p><p>
The aim of marking is to signal to the public that this work is copyrighted
and that the author wants to enforce his rights. The mark also makes it easy
to locate a copyright owner to secure permission to use the work.
</p><p>
One of the problems the copyright system confronted early on was that
different copyrighted works had to be differently marked. It wasn't clear
how or where a statue was to be marked, or a record, or a film. A new
marking requirement could solve these problems by recognizing the
differences in media, and by allowing the system of marking to evolve as
technologies enable it to. The system could enable a special signal from the
failure to mark&#8212;not the loss of the copyright, but the loss of the
right to punish someone for failing to get permission first.
</p><p>

Let's start with the last point. If a copyright owner allows his work to be
published without a copyright notice, the consequence of that failure need
not be that the copyright is lost. The consequence could instead be that
anyone has the right to use this work, until the copyright owner complains
and demonstrates that it is his work and he doesn't give
permission.<sup>[<a name="id2705702" href="#ftn.id2705702" class="footnote">213</a>]</sup> The meaning of an unmarked
work would therefore be "use unless someone complains." If someone does
complain, then the obligation would be to stop using the work in any new
work from then on though no penalty would attach for existing uses.  This
would create a strong incentive for copyright owners to mark their work.
</p><p>
That in turn raises the question about how work should best be marked. Here
again, the system needs to adjust as the technologies evolve. The best way
to ensure that the system evolves is to limit the Copyright Office's role to
that of approving standards for marking content that have been crafted
elsewhere.
</p><p>
For example, if a recording industry association devises a method for
marking CDs, it would propose that to the Copyright Office. The Copyright
Office would hold a hearing, at which other proposals could be made. The
Copyright Office would then select the proposal that it judged preferable,
and it would base that choice <span class="emphasis"><em>solely</em></span> upon the
consideration of which method could best be integrated into the registration
and renewal system. We would not count on the government to innovate; but we
would count on the government to keep the product of innovation in line with
its other important functions.
</p><p>
Finally, marking content clearly would simplify registration requirements.
If photographs were marked by author and year, there would be little reason
not to allow a photographer to reregister, for example, all photographs
taken in a particular year in one quick step. The aim of the formality is
not to burden the creator; the system itself should be kept as simple as
possible.
</p><p>
The objective of formalities is to make things clear. The existing system
does nothing to make things clear. Indeed, it seems designed to make things
unclear.
</p><p>
If formalities such as registration were reinstated, one of the most
difficult aspects of relying upon the public domain would be removed.  It
would be simple to identify what content is presumptively free; it would be
simple to identify who controls the rights for a particular kind of content;
it would be simple to assert those rights, and to renew that assertion at
the appropriate time.

Vernetiden i opphavsretten har gått fra fjorten år til nittifem år der

for individuelle forfattere.
</p><p>
In <em class="citetitle">The Future of Ideas</em>, I proposed a
seventy-five-year term, granted in five-year increments with a requirement
of renewal every five years.  That seemed radical enough at the time. But
after we lost <em class="citetitle">Eldred</em>
v. <em class="citetitle">Ashcroft</em>, the proposals became even more
radical. <em class="citetitle">The Economist</em> endorsed a proposal for a
fourteen-year copyright term.<sup>[<a name="id2705827" href="#ftn.id2705827" class="footnote">214</a>]</sup> Others
have proposed tying the term to the term for patents.
</p><p>
I agree with those who believe that we need a radical change in copyright's
term. But whether fourteen years or seventy-five, there are four principles
that are important to keep in mind about copyright terms.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>


<span class="emphasis"><em>Keep it short:</em></span> The term should be as long as necessary
to give incentives to create, but no longer. If it were tied to very strong
protections for authors (so authors were able to reclaim rights from
publishers), rights to the same work (not derivative works) might be
extended further. The key is not to tie the work up with legal regulations
when it no longer benefits an author.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>



<span class="emphasis"><em>Gjør det enkelt:</em></span> Skillelinjen mellom verker uten
opphavsrettslig vern og innhold som er beskyttet må forbli klart.  Advokater
liker uklarheten som "rimelig bruk" og forskjellen mellom "idéer" og
"uttrykk" har.  Denne type lovverk gir dem en masse arbeid.  Men de som
skrev grunnloven hadde en enklere idé: vernet versus ikke vernet. Verdien av
korte vernetider er at det er lite behov for å bygge inn unntak i
opphavsretten når vernetiden holdes kort.  En klar og aktiv "advokat-fri
sone" gjør komplesiteten av "rimelig bruk" og "idé/uttrykk" mindre nødvendig
å håndtere.

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

<span class="emphasis"><em>Keep it alive:</em></span> Copyright should have to be renewed.
Especially if the maximum term is long, the copyright owner should be
required to signal periodically that he wants the protection continued. This
need not be an onerous burden, but there is no reason this monopoly
protection has to be granted for free. On average, it takes ninety minutes
for a veteran to apply for a pension.<sup>[<a name="id2705915" href="#ftn.id2705915" class="footnote">215</a>]</sup>
If we make veterans suffer that burden, I don't see why we couldn't require
authors to spend ten minutes every fifty years to file a single form.
<a class="indexterm" name="id2705934"></a>
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>


<span class="emphasis"><em>Keep it prospective:</em></span> Whatever the term of copyright
should be, the clearest lesson that economists teach is that a term once
given should not be extended. It might have been a mistake in 1923 for the
law to offer authors only a fifty-six-year term. I don't think so, but it's
possible. If it was a mistake, then the consequence was that we got fewer
authors to create in 1923 than we otherwise would have. But we can't correct
that mistake today by increasing the term. No matter what we do today, we
will not increase the number of authors who wrote in 1923. Of course, we can
increase the reward that those who write now get (or alternatively, increase
the copyright burden that smothers many works that are today invisible). But
increasing their reward will not increase their creativity in 1923.  What's
not done is not done, and there's nothing we can do about that now.  </p></li></ol></div><p>
Disse endringene vil sammen gi en <span class="emphasis"><em>gjennomsnittlig</em></span>
opphavsrettslig vernetid som er mye kortere enn den gjeldende vernetiden.
Frem til 1976 var gjennomsnittelig vernetid kun 32.2 år.  Vårt mål bør være
det samme.
</p><p>
Uten tvil vil ekstremistene kalle disse idéene "radikale". (Tross alt, så
kaller jeg dem "ekstremister".) Men igjen, vernetiden jeg anbefalte var
lengre enn vernetiden under Richard Nixon. hvor "radikalt" kan det være å be
om en mer sjenerøs opphavsrettighet enn da Richard Nixon var president?
</p></div><div class="section" title="3. Fri Bruk vs. rimelig bruk"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="freefairuse"></a>3. Fri Bruk vs. rimelig bruk</h3></div></div></div><p>
As I observed at the beginning of this book, property law originally granted
property owners the right to control their property from the ground to the
heavens. The airplane came along. The scope of property rights quickly
changed. There was no fuss, no constitutional challenge.  It made no sense
anymore to grant that much control, given the emergence of that new
technology.
</p><p>
Our Constitution gives Congress the power to give authors "exclusive right"
to "their writings." Congress has given authors an exclusive right to "their
writings" plus any derivative writings (made by others) that are
sufficiently close to the author's original work. Thus, if I write a book,
and you base a movie on that book, I have the power to deny you the right to
release that movie, even though that movie is not "my writing."
</p><p>
Congress granted the beginnings of this right in 1870, when it expanded the
exclusive right of copyright to include a right to control translations and
dramatizations of a work.<sup>[<a name="id2706044" href="#ftn.id2706044" class="footnote">216</a>]</sup> The courts
have expanded it slowly through judicial interpretation ever since. This
expansion has been commented upon by one of the law's greatest judges, Judge
Benjamin Kaplan.
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So inured have we become to the extension of the monopoly to a large range
of so-called derivative works, that we no longer sense the oddity of
accepting such an enlargement of copyright while yet intoning the
abracadabra of idea and expression.<sup>[<a name="id2706068" href="#ftn.id2706068" class="footnote">217</a>]</sup>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I think it's time to recognize that there are airplanes in this field and
the expansiveness of these rights of derivative use no longer make
sense. More precisely, they don't make sense for the period of time that a
copyright runs. And they don't make sense as an amorphous grant.  Consider
each limitation in turn.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Term:</em></span> If Congress wants to grant a derivative right,
then that right should be for a much shorter term. It makes sense to protect
John Grisham's right to sell the movie rights to his latest novel (or at
least I'm willing to assume it does); but it does not make sense for that
right to run for the same term as the underlying copyright. The derivative
right could be important in inducing creativity; it is not important long
after the creative work is done.  <a class="indexterm" name="id2706098"></a>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Scope:</em></span> Likewise should the scope of derivative rights
be narrowed.  Again, there are some cases in which derivative rights are
important.  Those should be specified. But the law should draw clear lines
around regulated and unregulated uses of copyrighted material. When all
"reuse" of creative material was within the control of businesses, perhaps
it made sense to require lawyers to negotiate the lines. It no longer makes
sense for lawyers to negotiate the lines. Think about all the creative
possibilities that digital technologies enable; now imagine pouring molasses
into the machines. That's what this general requirement of permission does
to the creative process. Smothers it.
</p><p>
This was the point that Alben made when describing the making of the Clint
Eastwood CD. While it makes sense to require negotiation for foreseeable
derivative rights&#8212;turning a book into a movie, or a poem into a
musical score&#8212;it doesn't make sense to require negotiation for the
unforeseeable. Here, a statutory right would make much more sense.
</p><p>
In each of these cases, the law should mark the uses that are protected, and
the presumption should be that other uses are not protected.  This is the
reverse of the recommendation of my colleague Paul Goldstein.<sup>[<a name="id2706152" href="#ftn.id2706152" class="footnote">218</a>]</sup> His view is that the law should be written so that
expanded protections follow expanded uses.
</p><p>
Goldstein's analysis would make perfect sense if the cost of the legal
system were small. But as we are currently seeing in the context of the
Internet, the uncertainty about the scope of protection, and the incentives
to protect existing architectures of revenue, combined with a strong
copyright, weaken the process of innovation.
</p><p>

The law could remedy this problem either by removing protection beyond the
part explicitly drawn or by granting reuse rights upon certain statutory
conditions. Either way, the effect would be to free a great deal of culture
to others to cultivate. And under a statutory rights regime, that reuse
would earn artists more income.

The battle that got this whole war going was about music, so it wouldn't be
fair to end this book without addressing the issue that is, to most people,
most pressing&#8212;music. There is no other policy issue that better
teaches the lessons of this book than the battles around the sharing of
music.
</p><p>
The appeal of file-sharing music was the crack cocaine of the Internet's
growth. It drove demand for access to the Internet more powerfully than any
other single application. It was the Internet's killer app&#8212;possibly in
two senses of that word. It no doubt was the application that drove demand
for bandwidth. It may well be the application that drives demand for
regulations that in the end kill innovation on the network.
</p><p>
The aim of copyright, with respect to content in general and music in
particular, is to create the incentives for music to be composed, performed,
and, most importantly, spread. The law does this by giving an exclusive
right to a composer to control public performances of his work, and to a
performing artist to control copies of her performance.
</p><p>
File-sharing networks complicate this model by enabling the spread of
content for which the performer has not been paid. But of course, that's not
all the file-sharing networks do. As I described in chapter <a class="xref" href="#piracy" title='Kapittel 6. Kapittel fem: "Piratvirksomhet"'>6</a>, they enable four
different kinds of sharing:

Any reform of the law needs to keep these different uses in focus. It must
avoid burdening type D even if it aims to eliminate type A. The eagerness
with which the law aims to eliminate type A, moreover, should depend upon
the magnitude of type B. As with VCRs, if the net effect of sharing is
actually not very harmful, the need for regulation is significantly
weakened.
</p><p>
As I said in chapter <a class="xref" href="#piracy" title='Kapittel 6. Kapittel fem: "Piratvirksomhet"'>6</a>, the actual harm caused by sharing is controversial.  For
the purposes of this chapter, however, I assume the harm is real. I assume,
in other words, that type A sharing is significantly greater than type B,
and is the dominant use of sharing networks.
</p><p>
Uansett, det er et avgjørende faktum om den gjeldende teknologiske
omgivelsen som vi må huske på hvis vi skal forstå hvordan loven bør reagere.
</p><p>
Today, file sharing is addictive. In ten years, it won't be. It is addictive
today because it is the easiest way to gain access to a broad range of
content.  It won't be the easiest way to get access to a broad range of
content in ten years. Today, access to the Internet is cumbersome and
slow&#8212;we in the United States are lucky to have broadband service at
1.5 MBs, and very rarely do we get service at that speed both up and
down. Although wireless access is growing, most of us still get access
across wires. Most only gain access through a machine with a keyboard. The
idea of the always on, always connected Internet is mainly just an idea.
</p><p>

But it will become a reality, and that means the way we get access to the
Internet today is a technology in transition. Policy makers should not make
policy on the basis of technology in transition. They should make policy on
the basis of where the technology is going. The question should not be, how
should the law regulate sharing in this world? The question should be, what
law will we require when the network becomes the network it is clearly
becoming? That network is one in which every machine with electricity is
essentially on the Net; where everywhere you are&#8212;except maybe the
desert or the Rockies&#8212;you can instantaneously be connected to the
Internet. Imagine the Internet as ubiquitous as the best cell-phone service,
where with the flip of a device, you are connected.
</p><p>
In that world, it will be extremely easy to connect to services that give
you access to content on the fly&#8212;such as Internet radio, content that
is streamed to the user when the user demands. Here, then, is the critical
point: When it is <span class="emphasis"><em>extremely</em></span> easy to connect to services
that give access to content, it will be <span class="emphasis"><em>easier</em></span> to
connect to services that give you access to content than it will be to
download and store content <span class="emphasis"><em>on the many devices you will have for
playing content</em></span>. It will be easier, in other words, to subscribe
than it will be to be a database manager, as everyone in the
download-sharing world of Napster-like technologies essentially is. Content
services will compete with content sharing, even if the services charge
money for the content they give access to. Already cell-phone services in
Japan offer music (for a fee) streamed over cell phones (enhanced with plugs
for headphones). The Japanese are paying for this content even though "free"
content is available in the form of MP3s across the Web.<sup>[<a name="id2706397" href="#ftn.id2706397" class="footnote">219</a>]</sup>

</p><p>

This point about the future is meant to suggest a perspective on the
present: It is emphatically temporary. The "problem" with file
sharing&#8212;to the extent there is a real problem&#8212;is a problem that
will increasingly disappear as it becomes easier to connect to the
Internet.  And thus it is an extraordinary mistake for policy makers today
to be "solving" this problem in light of a technology that will be gone
tomorrow.  The question should not be how to regulate the Internet to
eliminate file sharing (the Net will evolve that problem away). The question
instead should be how to assure that artists get paid, during this
transition between twentieth-century models for doing business and
twenty-first-century technologies.
</p><p>
The answer begins with recognizing that there are different "problems" here
to solve. Let's start with type D content&#8212;uncopyrighted content or
copyrighted content that the artist wants shared. The "problem" with this
content is to make sure that the technology that would enable this kind of
sharing is not rendered illegal. You can think of it this way: Pay phones
are used to deliver ransom demands, no doubt.  But there are many who need
to use pay phones who have nothing to do with ransoms. It would be wrong to
ban pay phones in order to eliminate kidnapping.
</p><p>
Type C content raises a different "problem." This is content that was, at
one time, published and is no longer available. It may be unavailable
because the artist is no longer valuable enough for the record label he
signed with to carry his work. Or it may be unavailable because the work is
forgotten. Either way, the aim of the law should be to facilitate the access
to this content, ideally in a way that returns something to the artist.
</p><p>
Again, the model here is the used book store. Once a book goes out of print,
it may still be available in libraries and used book stores. But libraries
and used book stores don't pay the copyright owner when someone reads or
buys an out-of-print book. That makes total sense, of course, since any
other system would be so burdensome as to eliminate the possibility of used
book stores' existing. But from the author's perspective, this "sharing" of
his content without his being compensated is less than ideal.
</p><p>
The model of used book stores suggests that the law could simply deem
out-of-print music fair game. If the publisher does not make copies of the
music available for sale, then commercial and noncommercial providers would
be free, under this rule, to "share" that content, even though the sharing
involved making a copy. The copy here would be incidental to the trade; in a
context where commercial publishing has ended, trading music should be as
free as trading books.
</p><p>



Alternatively, the law could create a statutory license that would ensure
that artists get something from the trade of their work. For example, if the
law set a low statutory rate for the commercial sharing of content that was
not offered for sale by a commercial publisher, and if that rate were
automatically transferred to a trust for the benefit of the artist, then
businesses could develop around the idea of trading this content, and
artists would benefit from this trade.
</p><p>
This system would also create an incentive for publishers to keep works
available commercially. Works that are available commercially would not be
subject to this license. Thus, publishers could protect the right to charge
whatever they want for content if they kept the work commercially
available. But if they don't keep it available, and instead, the computer
hard disks of fans around the world keep it alive, then any royalty owed for
such copying should be much less than the amount owed a commercial
publisher.
</p><p>
The hard case is content of types A and B, and again, this case is hard only
because the extent of the problem will change over time, as the technologies
for gaining access to content change. The law's solution should be as
flexible as the problem is, understanding that we are in the middle of a
radical transformation in the technology for delivering and accessing
content.
</p><p>
Så her er en løsning som i første omgang kan virke veldig undelig for begge
sider i denne krigen, men som jeg tror vil gi mer mening når en får tenkt
seg om.
</p><p>
Stripped of the rhetoric about the sanctity of property, the basic claim of
the content industry is this: A new technology (the Internet)  has harmed a
set of rights that secure copyright. If those rights are to be protected,
then the content industry should be compensated for that harm. Just as the
technology of tobacco harmed the health of millions of Americans, or the
technology of asbestos caused grave illness to thousands of miners, so, too,
has the technology of digital networks harmed the interests of the content
industry.
</p><p>


Jeg elsker internett, så jeg liker ikke å sammenligne det med tobakk eller
asbest.  Men analogien er rimelig når en ser det fra lovens perspektiv. Og
det foreslår en rimelig respons: I stedet for å forsøke å ødelegge internett
eller p2p-teknologien som i dag skader innholdsleverandører på internett, så
bør vi finne en relativt enkel måte å kompensere de som blir skadelidende.
</p><p>
The idea would be a modification of a proposal that has been floated by
Harvard law professor William Fisher.<sup>[<a name="id2706558" href="#ftn.id2706558" class="footnote">220</a>]</sup>
Fisher suggests a very clever way around the current impasse of the
Internet. Under his plan, all content capable of digital transmission would
(1) be marked with a digital watermark (don't worry about how easy it is to
evade these marks; as you'll see, there's no incentive to evade them). Once
the content is marked, then entrepreneurs would develop (2) systems to
monitor how many items of each content were distributed. On the basis of
those numbers, then (3) artists would be compensated. The compensation would
be paid for by (4) an appropriate tax.
</p><p>
Fisher's proposal is careful and comprehensive. It raises a million
questions, most of which he answers well in his upcoming book,
<em class="citetitle">Promises to Keep</em>. The modification that I would make
is relatively simple: Fisher imagines his proposal replacing the existing
copyright system.  I imagine it complementing the existing system. The aim
of the proposal would be to facilitate compensation to the extent that harm
could be shown. This compensation would be temporary, aimed at facilitating
a transition between regimes. And it would require renewal after a period of
years. If it continues to make sense to facilitate free exchange of content,
supported through a taxation system, then it can be continued. If this form
of protection is no longer necessary, then the system could lapse into the
old system of controlling access.
</p><p>

Fisher would balk at the idea of allowing the system to lapse. His aim is
not just to ensure that artists are paid, but also to ensure that the system
supports the widest range of "semiotic democracy" possible. But the aims of
semiotic democracy would be satisfied if the other changes I described were
accomplished&#8212;in particular, the limits on derivative uses. A system
that simply charges for access would not greatly burden semiotic democracy
if there were few limitations on what one was allowed to do with the content
itself.
</p><p>
No doubt it would be difficult to calculate the proper measure of "harm" to
an industry. But the difficulty of making that calculation would be
outweighed by the benefit of facilitating innovation. This background system
to compensate would also not need to interfere with innovative proposals
such as Apple's MusicStore. As experts predicted when Apple launched the
MusicStore, it could beat "free" by being easier than free is. This has
proven correct: Apple has sold millions of songs at even the very high price
of 99 cents a song. (At 99 cents, the cost is the equivalent of a per-song
CD price, though the labels have none of the costs of a CD to pay.) Apple's
move was countered by Real Networks, offering music at just 79 cents a
song. And no doubt there will be a great deal of competition to offer and
sell music on-line.
</p><p>
This competition has already occurred against the background of "free" music
from p2p systems. As the sellers of cable television have known for thirty
years, and the sellers of bottled water for much more than that, there is
nothing impossible at all about "competing with free." Indeed, if anything,
the competition spurs the competitors to offer new and better products. This
is precisely what the competitive market was to be about. Thus in Singapore,
though piracy is rampant, movie theaters are often luxurious&#8212;with
"first class" seats, and meals served while you watch a movie&#8212;as they
struggle and succeed in finding ways to compete with "free."
</p><p>
Dette konkurranseregimet, med en sikringsmekanisme å sikre at kunstnere ikke
taper, ville bidra mye til nyskapning innen levering av
innhold. Konkurransen ville fortsette å redusere type-A-deling.  Det ville
inspirere en ekstraordinær rekke av nye innovatører&#8212;som ville ha
retten til a bruke innhold, og ikke lenger frykte usikre og barbarisk
strenge straffer fra loven.
</p><p>
Oppsummert, så er dette mitt forslag:
</p><p>



Internett er i endring. Vi bør ikke regulere en teknologi i endring. Vi bør
i stedet regulere for å minimere skaden påført interesser som er berørt av
denne teknologiske endringen, samtidig vi muliggjør, og oppmuntrer, den mest
effektive teknologien vi kan lage.
</p><p>
Vi kan minimere skaden og samtidig maksimere fordelen med innovasjon ved å
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>


garantere retten til å engasjere seg i type-D-deling;
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>


tillate ikke-kommersiell type-C-deling uten erstatningsansvar, og
kommersiell type-C-deling med en lav og fast rate fastsatt ved lov.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>


mens denne overgangen pågår, skattlegge og kompensere for type-A-deling, i
den grad faktiske skade kan påvises.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Men hva om "piratvirksomheten" ikke forsvinner?  Hva om det finnes et
konkurranseutsatt marked som tilbyr innhold til en lav kostnad, men et
signifikant antall av forbrukere fortsetter å "ta" innhold uten å betale?
Burde loven gjøre noe da?
</p><p>
Ja, det bør den.  Men, nok en gang, hva den bør gjøre avhenger hvordan
realitetene utvikler seg. Disse endringene fjerner kanskje ikke all
type-A-deling. Men det virkelige spørmålet er ikke om de eliminerer deling i
abstrakt betydning.  Det virkelige spørsmålet er hvilken effekt det har på
markedet.  Er det bedre (a) å ha en teknologi som er 95 prosent sikker og
gir et marked av størrelse <em class="citetitle">x</em>, eller (b) å ha en
teknologi som er 50 prosent sikker, og som gir et marked som er fem ganger
større enn <em class="citetitle">x</em>?  Mindre sikker kan gi mer uautorisert
deling, men det vil sannsynligvis også gi et mye større marked for
autorisert deling. Det viktigste er å sikre kunstneres kompensasjon uten å
ødelegge internettet.  Når det er på plass, kan det hende det er riktig å
finne måter å spore opp de smålige piratene.
</p><p>

Men vi er langt unna å spikke problemet ned til dette delsettet av
type-A-delere.  Og vårt fokus inntil er der bør ikke være å finne måter å
ødelegge internettet.  Var fokus inntil vi er der bør være hvordan sikre at
artister får betalt, mens vi beskytter rommet for nyskapning og kreativitet
som internettet er.
</p></div><div class="section" title="5. Spark en masse advokater"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="firelawyers"></a>5. Spark en masse advokater</h3></div></div></div><p>
Jeg er en advokat. Jeg lever av å utdanne advokater. Jeg tror på loven. Jeg
tror på opphavsrettsloven. Jeg har faktisk viet livet til å jobbe med loven,
ikke fordi det er mye penger å tjene, men fordi det innebærer idealer som
jeg elsker å leve opp til.
</p><p>
Likevel har mye av denne boken vært kritikk av advokater, eller rollen
advokater har spilt i denne debatten.  Loven taler om idealer, mens det er
min oppfatning av vår yrkesgruppe er blitt for knyttet til klienten.  Og i
en verden der rike klienter har sterke synspunkter vil uviljen hos vår
yrkesgruppe til å stille spørsmål med eller protestere mot dette sterke
synet ødelegge loven.
</p><p>
Indisiene for slik bøyning er overbevisene.  Jeg er angrepet som en
"radikal" av mange innenfor yrket, og likevel er meningene jeg argumenterer
for nøyaktig de meningene til mange av de mest moderate og betydningsfulle
personene i historien til denne delen av loven. Mange trodde for eksempel at
vår utfordring til lovforslaget om å utvide opphavsrettens vernetid var
galskap.  Mens bare tredve år siden mente den dominerende foreleser og
utøver i opphavsrettsfeltet, Melville Nimmer, at den var
åpenbar.<sup>[<a name="id2706932" href="#ftn.id2706932" class="footnote">221</a>]</sup>

</p><p>
Min kritikk av rollen som advokater har spilt i denne debatten handler
imidlertid ikke bare om en profesjonell skjevhet. Det handler enda viktigere
om vår manglende evne til å faktisk ta inn over oss hva loven koster.
</p><p>
Økonomer er forventet å være gode til å forstå utgifter og inntekter.  Men
som oftest antar økonomene uten peiling på hvordan det juridiske systemet
egentlig fungerer, at transaksjonskostnaden i det juridiske systemet er
lav.<sup>[<a name="id2706965" href="#ftn.id2706965" class="footnote">222</a>]</sup>  De ser et system som har
eksistert i hundrevis av år, og de antar at det fungerer slik grunnskolens
samfunnsfagsundervisning lærte dem at det fungerer.
</p><p>


Men det juridiske systemet fungerer ikke. Eller for å være mer nøyaktig, det
fungerer kun for de med mest ressurser.  Det er ikke fordi systemet er
korrupt. Jeg tror overhodet ikke vårt juridisk system (på føderalt nivå, i
hvert fall) er korrupt. Jeg mener ganske enkelt at på grunn av at kostnadene
med vårt juridiske systemet er så hårreisende høyt vil en praktisk talt
aldri oppnå rettferdighet.
</p><p>
Disse kostnadene forstyrrer fri kultur på mange vis.  En advokats tid
faktureres hos de største firmaene for mer enn $400 pr. time. Hvor mye tid
bør en slik advokat bruke på å lese sakene nøye, eller undersøke obskure
rettskilder.  Svaret er i økende grad: svært lite. Jussen er avhengig av
nøye formulering og utvikling av doktrine, men nøye formulering og utvikling
av doktrine er avhengig av nøyaktig arbeid.  Men nøyaktig arbeid koster for
mye, bortsett fra i de mest høyprofilerte og kostbare sakene.
</p><p>
Kostbarheten, klomsetheten og tilfeldigheten til dette systemet håner vår
tradisjon. Og advokater, såvel som akademikere, bør se det som sin plikt å
endre hvordan loven praktiseres&#8212; eller bedre, endre loven slik at den
fungerer. Det er galt at systemet fungerer godt bare for den øverste
1-prosenten av klientene.  Det kan gjøres radikalt mer effektivt, og billig,
og dermed radikalt mer rettferdig.
</p><p>
Men inntil en slik reform er gjennomført, bør vi som samfunn holde lover
unna områder der vi vet den bare vil skade.  Og det er nettopp det loven
altfor ofte vil gjøre hvis for mye av vår kultur er lovregulert.
</p><p>
Tenk på de fantastiske tingene ditt barn kan gjøre eller lage med digital
teknologi&#8212;filmen, musikken, web-siden, bloggen. Eller tenk på de
fantastiske tingene ditt fellesskap kunne få til med digital
teknologi&#8212;en wiki, oppsetting av låve, kampanje til å endre noe. Tenk
på alle de kreative tingene, og tenk deretter på kald sirup helt inn i
maskinene. Dette er hva et hvert regime som krever tillatelser fører
til. Dette er virkeligheten slik den var i Brezhnevs Russland.
</p><p>

Loven bør regulere i visse områder av kulturen&#8212;men det bør regulere
kultur bare der reguleringen bidrar positivt. Likevel tester advokater
sjeldent sin kraft, eller kraften som de fremmer, mot dette enkle pragmatisk
spørsmålet: "vil det bidra positivt?".  Når de blir utfordret om det
utvidede rekkevidden til loven, er advokat-svaret, "Hvorfor ikke?"
</p><p>
Vi burde spørre: "Hvorfor?". Vis meg hvorfor din regulering av kultur er
nødvendig og vis meg hvordan reguleringen bidrar positivt.  Før du kan vise
meg begge, holde advokatene din unna.

Et godt eksempel er arbeidet til professor Stan Liebowitz. Liebowitz bør få
ros for sin nøye gjennomgang av data om opphavsrettsbrudd, som fikk ham til
å stille spørsmål med sin egen uttalte posisjon&#8212;to ganger.  I starten
predicated han at nedlasting ville påføre industrien vesentlig skade.  Han
endret så sitt syn etter i lys av dataene, og han har siden endret sitt syn
på nytt.  Sammenlign Stan J. Liebowitz, <em class="citetitle">Rethinking the Network

York: Amacom, 2002), (gikk igjennom hans originale syn men uttrykte skepsis)

fildelingsteknologi.  Etter mitt syn underestimerer han forøvrig kostnaden
til det juridiske system.  Se, for eksempel,

I denne teksten er det referanser til lenker på verdensveven.  Og som alle
som har forsøkt å bruke nettet vet, så vil disse lenkene være svært
ustabile.  Jeg har forsøkt å motvirke denne ustabiliteten ved å omdirigere
lesere til den originale kilden gjennom en nettside som hører til denne
boken.  For hver lenke under, så kan du gå til http://free-culture.cc/notes
og finne den originale kilden ved å klikke på nummeret etter #-tegnet.  Hvis
den originale lenken fortsatt er i live, så vil du bli omdirigert til den
lenken.  Hvis den originale lenken har forsvunnet, så vil du bli omdirigert
til en passende referanse til materialet.

Denne boken er produktet av en lang og så langt mislykket kamp som begynte
da jeg leste om Eric Eldreds krig for å sørge for at bøker forble
frie. Eldreds innsats bidro til å lansere en bevegelse, fri
kultur-bevegelsen, og denne boken er tilegnet ham.
</p><p>
Jeg fikk veiledning på ulike steder fra venner og akademikere, inkludert
Glenn Brown, Peter DiCola, Jennifer Mnookin, Richard Posner, Mark Rose og
Kathleen Sullivan. Og jeg fikk korreksjoner og veiledning fra mange
fantastiske studenter ved Stanford Law School og Stanford University. Det
inkluderer Andrew B. Coan, John Eden, James P. Fellers, Christopher
Guzelian, Erica Goldberg, Robert Hallman, Andrew Harris, Matthew Kahn,
Brian-Link, Ohad Mayblum, Alina Ng og Erica Platt. Jeg er særlig takknemlig
overfor Catherine Crump og Harry Surden, som hjalp til med å styre deres
forskning og til Laura Lynch, som briljant håndterte hæren de samlet, samt
bidro med sitt egen kritisk blikk på mye av dette.
</p><p>

Yuko Noguchi hjalp meg å forstå lovene i Japan, så vel som Japans
kultur. Jeg er henne takknemlig, og til de mange i Japan som hjalp meg med
forundersøkelsene til denne boken: Joi Ito, Takayuki Matsutani, Naoto
Misaki, Michihiro Sasaki, Hiromichi Tanaka, Hiroo Yamagata og Yoshihiro
Yonezawa.  Jeg er også takknemlig til professor Nobuhiro Nakayama og Tokyo
University Business Law Center, som ga meg muligheten til å bruke tid i
Japan, og Tadashi Shiraishi og Kiyokazu Yamagami for deres generøse hjelp
mens jeg var der.
</p><p>
Dette er de tradisjonelle former for hjelp som akademikere regelmessig
trekker på. Men i tillegg til dem, har Internett gjort det mulig å motta råd
og korrigering fra mange som jeg har aldri møtt.  Blant de som har svart med
svært nyttig råd etter forespørsler om boken på bloggen min er Dr. Muhammed
Al-Ubaydli, David Gerstein og Peter Dimauro, I tillegg en lang liste med de
som hadde spesifikke ideer om måter å utvikle mine argumenter på.  De
inkluderte Richard Bondi, Steven Cherry, David Coe, Nik Cubrilovic, Bob
Devine, Charles Eicher, Thomas Guida, Elihu M. Gerson, Jeremy Hunsinger,
Vaughn Iverson, John Karabaic, Jeff Keltner, James Lindenschmidt,
K. L. Mann, Mark Manning, Nora McCauley, Jeffrey McHugh, Evan McMullen, Fred
Norton, John Pormann, Pedro A. D.  Rezende, Shabbir Safdar, Saul Schleimer,
Clay Shirky, Adam Shostack, Kragen Sitaker, Chris Smith, Bruce Steinberg,
Andrzej Jan Taramina, Sean Walsh, Matt Wasserman, Miljenko Williams, "Wink,"
Roger Wood, "Ximmbo da Jazz," og Richard Yanco. (jeg beklager hvis jeg gikk
glipp av noen, med datamaskiner kommer feil og en krasj i e-postsystemet
mitt gjorde at jeg mistet en haug med flotte svar.)
</p><p>
Richard Stallman og Michael Carroll har begge lest hele boken i utkast, og
hver av dem har bidratt med svært nyttige korreksjoner og råd. Michael hjalp
meg å se mer tydelig betydningen av regulering for avledede verker . Og
Richard korrigerte en pinlig stor mengde feil.  Selv om mitt arbeid er
delvis inspirert av Stallmans, er han ikke enig med meg på vesentlige steder
i denne boken.
</p><p>
Til slutt, og for evig, er jeg Bettina takknemlig, som alltid har insistert
på at det ville være endeløs lykke utenfor disse kampene, og som alltid har
hatt rett.  Denne trege eleven er som alltid takknemlig for hennes
evigvarende tålmodighet og kjærlighet.
